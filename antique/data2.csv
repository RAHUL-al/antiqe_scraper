Mayer has beautifully captured the classroom setting with a mid-19 century teacher bringing his class together with various scriptures and lessons. The boy with a dunce cap is in time-out for acting improperly while in class, while the other kids are learning various subjects, such as math and English.

Constant Mayer was a French painter who moved to the United States in 1854. He was born in Besancon, France and studied in the Ecole des Beaux-Art school in Paris under Leon Cogniet. He was elected as an associate of the Legion of Honor and was also elected as an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1866, as well as a member of the American Art Union. Many of Constant Mayer's works are found in world-renowned museums, which include the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

The clock consists of polychrome hand-painted porcelain and gilt ormolu decoration. Characterized by their extravagant use of Rococo design motifs, mantel clocks such as this one were used not for their practicality, but as a display of immoderation and opulence.

Atop the vessel is a spray of gilt spring flowers: daffodils, foxgloves, roses, and morning bells. The ormolu fixtures on the clock face, stem, and apex complement the painted flowers on the surface of the porcelain.   Above the hands on the clock face reads “Maniere” in reference to the clock’s designer, Charles-Guillaume Manière. As the son of a Parisian master clockmaker, Manière became a master himself in the late 18th century and trained under other notable French designers. His work was often made in collaboration with Pierre-Philippe Thomire and François Rémond who possibly made the ormolu casing for his clock.  This is a very rare and highly prized piece for any collection. Similar clocks can be found in museum's around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NY and other museums around the world.

While Westerners have been influenced by Ancient Egyptian motifs for centuries, there was a distinct stylistic revival in the late 1700's and early 1800's due to European expansion and colonization of Northern Africa. Decorative elements from Ancient Egyptian architecture began to surface in European design, particularly in interior spaces.

The head is made from hand carved white Carrara marble, the tunic and toga are made from hand carved honey alabaster, which are all supported on a cipollino marble socle. The bust rests on a robust column of red Breccia Pernice marble, mounted on a Carrara marble base and top.

The detail to this bust is truly exceptional. The quality of a marble bust is noted from a few factors; the first being the hair of the bust. Hair is an extremely delicate and free-flowing body part, which makes it very difficult to hand-carve with a realistic feel. The next factor in marble bust quality is demonstrated in the face. Humans have distinct characteristics that sets them apart from one another. An exceptional bust allows someone to just glance upon it and recognize the person immediately. The final factor in marble bust quality is the clothes. Like hair, fabrics are free-flowing in nature, with variable curves and inconsistencies. A true master marble sculptor will exceptionally carve the general attire of the bust, in this case a tunic and toga, to resemble that of a free-flowing garment in the breeze, with curves and silhouettes. This bust of the Roman Emperor Titus Domitian reflects all these key characteristics and more. The hair is elegantly hand carved with exceptional detail, seemingly life-like in appearance. The facial features are perfectly in line with what Emperor Titus Domitian's is regarded to look like, a strong Romanesco nose, lightly wrinkled forehead, frowning eyebrows, a mid-sized mouth, and well-carved ears with a slight left head tilt. Finally, the garments on this bust, which include the tunic and toga, are exceptionally well hand carved, demonstrating natural free-flowing linen silhouettes, curves and billows. The culmination of these key-characteristics define this marble bust as truly exceptional.

Titus Flavius Caesar Domitianus Augustus was Roman emperor from 81 to 96 AD. He was the younger brother of Titus and the son of Vespasian, his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the Flavian dynasty. Domitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. His 15-year reign was the longest since that of Tiberius. As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage, expanded the border defenses of the Empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome.",0

Baccarat is a French luxury crystal company that manufactures and sells high-end products. Founded in 1764 by artisans in Lorraine with the permission of King Louis XV, Baccarat is known for its craftsmanship, quality, and innovation. The company's products include lighting, tableware, decorative objects, fine jewelry, and custom flacons, and are designed to symbolize French artifacts.

The fleur-de-lis is a stylized lily or iris with three petals that's often used as a decoration or heraldic charge. The term comes from the French words fleur (""flower"") and lis (""lily""). The fleur-de-lis has a long history and has been used in many different ways, including:
Royal coat of arms
French kings used the fleur-de-lis as a symbol of their sovereignty, and it was featured on the traditional French coat of arms from the High Middle Ages until the French Revolution in 1792. English kings also used the symbol on their coats of arms to emphasize their claims to the French throne.",0

Meissen plaques are incredibly rare and this subject is probably one of the rarest ever produced. The plaque is hand-painted by the best artists in the Meissen Porcelain Manufacturer in the ""Golden Age"" of Meissen creation. This plaque is an inspiration of the incredible quality, variable levels of light and dark, and loving attention to Saskia, Rembrandt's wife. The plaque depicts Rembrandt and Saskia drinking together in a Tavern. Both figures in the plaque are one-in-one with Rembrandt's vision on variable light and dark themes, as well as highly detailed and complimentary brush strokes. The back of Rembrandt's hat and body is slightly darker than the opposite side where Saskia is seated; this depicts his thoughtful process of mapping out light and dark trends in his works of art. The quality, technical ability, and perfect color balance of this plaque are superb and most probably one of the greatest plaques ever to be produced by Meissen. Meissen is the foremost creator of Porcelain Plaques and this particular subject is on top of them all. The back of the plaque consists of Underglaze blue crossed swords mark.

Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was born in Leiden in the Netherlands in 1606. In around 1631, Rembrandt lodged in the house of an art dealer called Hendrick van Uylenburgh, and while there, he met his landlord's young cousin Saskia and got married in 1634. Rembrandt is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of art, possessing an exceptional ability to render people in their various moods and dramatic guises.

'Rembrandt und Saskia im Gleichnis vom verlorenen Sohn' is housed in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister of Dresden, Germany and was painted in 1637 as an oil on canvas. Rembrandt is also known as a painter of light and shade and as an artist who favored an uncompromising realism that would lead some critics to claim that he preferred ugliness to beauty. Rembrandt is renowned for his outstanding ability to render the human figure and its emotions. Another aspect of Rembrandt’s genius is the acute and loving attention with which he observed the world around him. In his renderings of women and children and of animals and landscapes, he showed a strong understanding of the significant detail, but he noted these impressions with extraordinary freedom and economy.

Charles Le Hon, a Belgian politician, lawyer and industrialist, served as Ambassador to France and deputy to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives. He was created Count in 1836 and a Minister of State in 1856. Fanny Mosselman, a Belgian noblewoman, married Le Hon in 1827 and they had three children Eugène (1828-1860), Louis Xavier Léopold (1832-1879) and Louise (1838-1931). They occupied her father's hotel particuliere in the Chaussée d'Antin, Paris from 1831 and the Hôtel Le Hon, rond-point de Champs-Elysée from 1843. Fanny was very socially prominent, her glittering Paris salon attended by famous politicians and members of the Royal Family. Her lovers included the duc d'Orléans and most famously the duc de Morny, illegitimate son of Queen Hortense and therefore half-brother of Emperor Napoleon III. Honoré de Balzac described her as ""Iris in light blue, the golden haired Ambassadress"".
This splendid coffre-fort or strong box conceived in the neo renaissance style of the late 1830s is decorated with the arms of Le Hon and Mosselman below a Count's coronet as well as decorated with acanthus arabesque. As Le Hon was created a Count in 1836 its manufacture must post date this. It is also likely to have been manufactured in Paris where the Le Hon lived.
Interestingly in 1851 their son Eugène married his cousin on his mother's side, Charlotte Mosselman (1837-1912). Their son René was born in 1858. It is therefore also possible that this box was commissioned by Eugene's parents as a wedding gift in 1851. As his wife was also a Mosselman, the arms would have been equally appropriate for them as for their parents.",":

This incredible sculpture is by Jean-Léon Gérôme (French, 1824-1904), one of the most famous and inspirational Academic French artists of the 1800s, who started to cast and make object art, like sculptures, in the later years of his career.

This amazing sculpture is called 'Bacchante à L'Amour' or 'Bacchante à la Grappe'. The piece is made out of ormolu or doré bronze and demonstrates bacchante, who is a woman follower of Bacchus. Bacchus is the Greek G-D of parties and wine, otherwise known in Roman mythology as Dionysus. Bacchante is seen with her head against a thyrsos, a special staff created of a fennel plant. At the top is an acorn finial with vines around it. The thyrsos and Bacchus are symbolic of fertility, wealth, and a life-time of pleasures. At the mid section of the thyrsos is a beautiful ormolu putti climbing up while the Bacchante holds fruit, most probably grapes, above him.

The figure is mounted on a round base with Jean-Léon Gérôme's signiture, 'JL. Gérôme' as well as the number C575. The Parisian Foundry mark can also be found on the base from Siot-Decauville, Paris, the location where this figure was cast. The figure was made in 1892 in three size variations.

On either side of the vase are two decorative handles, made out to be fancifully embellished elephant’s heads. The inclusion of elephants—which were introduced to French culture through Imperialism and trade between Western Europe and Asia—are significant of the Orientalist ideology that emerged in the 19th century. French designers looked to “exotic” and unfamiliar imagery to incorporate into their traditional European motifs.  The lamp is signed by Ferdinand Barbedienne, a French metalworker and sculptor well-known for his bronze working skills. For much of his career, he focused on making miniature replicas of statues and eventually expanded to produce household furnishings. His hope was to democratize the exclusivity of French empire luxuries and widen accessibility to the working class.

The centerpiece boasts a substantial and graceful curved base, complemented by a striking peaked and square-edged lip atop the vessel.

The significance behind the depiction of the three-clawed dragons stems from the Japanese belief that Eastern dragons originated within their native land. According to their folklore, as these majestic creatures ventured away from Japan, they acquired additional toes. The Japanese Sky dragon, associated with the realm of clouds and the heavens, is often portrayed without wings, despite their ability to soar through the sky. This aerial ability is attributed to a magical knot, known as Chi'ih muh, located atop their heads. 

The traditional depiction of Japanese dragons, akin to other Asian dragons, portrays them as slender and serpentine creatures, combining features from nine different animals. These elements include the chin whiskers of a deer, the head of a camel, the eyes of a rabbit, the neck of a snake, the abdomen of a cockle, the scales of a carp, the claws of an eagle, the paws of a tiger, and the ears of an ox.

The vase is cast with taotie masks, the basin is impressed with religious symbolism, and the handles act as two opposing dragons. The various patterned elements on this vase encompass popular Chinese bronze casting and relief carving motifs.  This vase was later turned to a lamp without the need of comprimising the original piece.  The bronze vase is in original condition with minimal ware.

This particular vase is an ancient Chinese Zun, a ritual wine vessel characterized by a flared opening and bulging midsection. The outside of the vase features a high and low relief decoration that is significant to Chinese symbolism. Along the neck is a relief of twirling, whipping clouds: the winds of chi’i. On the large relief on the basin, there is a relief decoration with archaic motifs like taotie masks and stylized dragons. Vases were often made to furnish the tombs of the Chinese elite. Thus, these vessels were imbued with religious symbolism and imagery to evoke otherworldly spirits for good fortune in the afterlife.

Religious symbolism is an important aspect of this vase. The winds of chi’i on the neck represent the energy of the universe, while the dragon handles symbolize great power and strength. The taotie motif on the basin holds multiple meanings—it has been interpreted as “one of the four evil creatures of the world.” It is commonly represented on Chinese ritual bronze vessels to demonstrate their mystical power and their relationship between humankind and the afterlife.

As the national porcelain manufactory of France, the Sèvres porcelain factory’s marks and backstamps mirrored changes in the government – hence the R.F. mark on a pair of vases dated 1849, the year after the beginning of the short-lived Second Republic and two years before its demise. Designed in 1840 by Jean-Charles-François Leloy (active at Sèvres as a designer of shapes 1818- 1844), the Vase Adélaïde was produced in two or three sizes. Examples of the largest are to be found in the collections of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam and at the Musée de Condé in Chantilly outside of Paris. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has two examples decorated in the same Limoges enamel style as that at Chantilly. One was acquired in 1844, the other in 1901 but they form a pair of the second size.
The Vase Adélaïde is named for Louise Marie Adélaïde Eugénie d'Orléans, Mademoiselle de Chartres, known as Madame Adélaïde (1777- 1847), younger sister of King Louis Philippe of France (1773-1850) who ruled France from 1830 until the revolution of 1848 brought in the Second Republic. Her brother’s closest confidant, she is recorded as having given him a pair of ‘her’ vases in 1840. In 1851, a coup by Napoleon III brought him to power, initiating the Second Empire. ",0

A fantastic early Lingam model in an octagonal form on a square base which rises up to a rounded top. Around the rounded top is a thin engraved line which runs horizontally and vertically at one point. This engraving is indicative to a foreskin on a penis. The Lingam is made in three distinct sections which symbolize the amalgamation of the three major deities of the Hindu Trinity: Brahma, The Creator (the cube base), Vishnu, The Preserver (the mid-section octagon), and Shiva, The Destroyer and Renewer (the top portion of the abstracted phallus or penis, the rounded top part). Lingam's were very important to past Hindu culture. In ancient times, in the Hindu religion, sex and sexual body parts were an integral part of the religion. Lingam refers to an ""outward symbol"" of the ""formless reality"", the representation of merging of the realistic physical form (Prak?ti) with a formless Reality (Purusha) in an otherworldly context. Shiva, otherwise known as Mahadeva, is the Almighty G-D of destruction and renewal. Shiva is known to not have a Lingam, due to the fact that Shiva transcended above sexual organs. This statue and its counterpart, Yoni (Pindika), from the G-DDESS Shakti, represent human sexual organs and desires, which demonstrates the difference between man and G-D. Sexual desires and physical embodiments of sexual activities were integral parts of ancient religions, which later manifested into the religions that they are today.

These were produced around the same time as the pot-pourri , in 1758 by Jean-Claude Duplessis, one of the foremost ceramic porcelain modelers for the Sevres company from 1748-1774. The candelabras are called, vase à tête d'éléphant, which translates to elephant head vase. These were originally designed as vases with an intent to place candelabra arms on them, and this pair is of no exception with gorgeous candelabra arms which continue from the trunks of the elephant heads. These candelabras are truly incredible with a pink-ground, hand-painted panels of multiple putti's playing in the clouds, a gorgeous base with white accents, and to top it off, each section is hand-painted with multi-colored flowers and finished in 24K gold. The bottoms of each of this marvelous pieces are marked in gold with French porcelain marks. Sets like this garniture are extremely rare and even more difficult to find in this quality and condition.

The seven-armed candelabra are carried on neoclassic urns decorated with rams' heads and laurel wreath swags.

Caldwell and Co. were America's greatest designers and manufacturers of decorative metal items and lighting. Founded in 1895 by Edward F. Caldwell and Victor von Lossberg, the firm would go on to do homes for the Gilded Age's greatest oligarchs, including various Vanderbilts, Morgans and Fricks. The Harvard Club, the Flatiron Building and Rockefeller Center are a small part of their legacy.

There are so many projects in America and abroad that they are far too numerous to mention. However they all have one thing in common, an absolute dedication to producing the finest works of art. 

The company's designers drew on centuries of European and Oriental design traditions combining motifs from the 15th century with others selected from the 16th through 20th centuries. Their early championing of the Art Deco style allowed them to become the pre-eminent designers and craftsmen working in this style. One only has to visit Rockefeller center to see their supreme mastery of this style. 

Their staff of designers and craftsmen made objects finer than had been created since the Renaissance, when bronze makers like Michaelangelo, Donatello and DaVinci set the standards very high. 

The chasers, chasers and gilders reached back in time to rediscover lost techniques, and improved existing ones, like the lost wax method. This allowed the artisans to recreate the finest imaginations of the artist's mind, to rise from the void and be made real to the astonishment of the beholder.

Their techniques were so highly developed, they could probably have cast the breath of God if the opportunity had arisen. 

Our lamps are great examples of Caldwell's ability to bend molten bronze to their will, and we are all the better for it.

To remind, the lamps are 65 x 15 and have been recently rewired.",0

This remarkable and historically significant antique terracotta portrait plaque bears the signature of the artist, Jean-Baptiste Nini, renowned for his expertise in creating terracotta portrait plaques during the 1700s in Paris. The plaque features a hand-crafted relief portrait of King Louis XVI in side profile, capturing the monarch's distinctive aquiline nose, curls, a ribbon securing his low ponytail and a wrapped collar, fashionable with French monarchy of the time.

Jean-Baptiste Nini's unique technique of casting terracotta entailed the use of refined local clay, processed using elutriation prior to being molded by finely detailed engraved copper molds to create his sought-after terracotta portraits.

The plaque is tastefully encased within an exquisite round French dore bronze frame, intricately carved with stylized feather motifs in relief. A movable hanging ring in dore bronze, also beautifully hand-carved in relief resembling a wreath, adorns the piece. The dore bronze rectangular clasps at the back neatly and securely hold the plaque in place.

The artist's signature and the date ""1780"" are inscribed below the bust. Jean-Baptiste Nini's medallions, especially those depicting eminent figures like King Louis XVI, are rare finds. Notably, the Metropolitan Museum of Art houses a collection of Nini's medallions, yet this particular piece remains exclusive to private collectors, making it a cherished gem for art enthusiasts.

This well-preserved and scarce artwork is sure to captivate the heart of any discerning art collector. Over time, the terracotta has acquired a lovely patina, with darker areas that highlight its depth and add character.

This terracotta portrait plaque by Jean-Baptiste Nini is a testament to the artist's exceptional skills and an invaluable historical artifact that immortalizes the likeness of one of the most iconic figures in French history. Beyond its artistic beauty, it serves as a window into the cultural ambiance of Paris in the 1700s, making it a truly remarkable and prized piece of art from a bygone era.",0

He was recommended by Roentgen to the Bayreuther Hof of Herzog Friedrich Eugen von Württemberg, where he was in charge of the furnishing of Schloss Fantaisie. In 1795 Klinckerfuss worked in the herzogliche Kabinettschreinerei for the Stuttgarter Hof, where he became cabinet-ebeniste for Duke Frederick II of Württemberg, later the first king of Württemberg.

Each with an ovoid body applied with an ormolu band depicting winged figures feeding with panthers, the top and base with pierced foliate and palmette mounts, with hippocampus-form handle terminating in a ram's mask, on malachite shaft and square base, minor variations to chasing, particularly to handles. These precious ewers, with their striking and unusual malachite bodies, were likely made to appeal to the Russian market. Malachite is most closely associated with the Russian Imperial Factories of the 18th and 19th centuries, whose highly skilled stone-cutting led to the creation of some of the most beautiful objets d'art. The Imperial administration held the sole right to mine for malachite from the Ural Mountains, so the products of these factories were almost exclusively destined for Imperial palaces or to be given as diplomatic gifts, making them very desirable. These ewers were created using the technique of ‘Russian mosaic,” where malachite is sawn into very thin slices, applied to a stone or metal ground with the veins laid to form pleasing patterns and then polished, making the joins barely visible. By creating malachite objects that call to mind the Imperial Factories of Russia and mounting them with fine ormolu details, the makers of the present ewers deftly balance Russian taste with French refinement.
The ovoid form of the ewers with their slender elongated spouts and figural handles are closely related to the oeuvre of the bronzier Claude Galle (1759-1815). Galle flourished during the Empire when he supplied bronzes and ormolu mounts for furniture, clocks and other decorative items to Compiègne, Versailles, Saint-Cloud, the Grand Trianon, and various other Courts throughout Europe. These ewers are similar to Galle's 'maiden' vases and his popular series of ewers, examples of which are illustrated in H. Ottomeyer, P. Pröschel et al., Vergoldete Bronzen, Munich, 1986, vol. I, figs. 5.12.6, 5.12.8 and 5.12.9, pp. 364 – 365 and are also at Pavlovsk, illustrated in E. Ducamp ed., Pavlovsk The Collections, Paris, 1993, p. 179. The vases and ewers all bear exquisitely detailed handles, mostly in the form of winged maidens rather than the more rare hippocampi figures employed on the present pair.

The woman is surrounded by elongated acanthus leaves that coil into loose spirals. Above and beneath her are thick blue lines that differentiate the frieze from the mouth and base of the vase.

George Woodall is well known for being one of the most important cameo crystal/glass cutters of the 1800's.  The piece is signed, ""G Woodall"".
Founded in 1837, Thomas Webb & Sons quickly established a reputation as the “Crystal King of England,” cementing this title with prizes at London’s Great Exhibition of 1851 and Paris’ Exposition Universelle of 1878. Prompted by the success of Portland Vase replicas by competitors Northwood and Locke, Thomas Webb & Sons shifted its focus from crystal to cameo glass by 1880, hiring George and Thomas Woodall, who formed the firm’s Woodall Team. The Woodall brothers, who trained as apprentices at J. & J. Northwood and later served as designers at Dennis Glass Works, revolutionized cameo glass with both technical innovations and aesthetic achievements. The Woodalls developed and utilized blue-tinged, rather than opaque, white glass gradually removed to produce a wide range of shades over a plum or burgundy ground, creating a semi-transparent, luminous effect. They also employed cutting wheels extensively in order to increase efficiency and meet the public’s voracious demand. George Woodall, considered the greatest cameo glass artist during its height from 1880 to 1910, was renowned for the breadth of his design sources, including Neoclassical and Oriental, his technical prowess, and his prolific output.",0

This marvelous figure is after the incredible Meissen designer Johann-Joachim Kaendler (Kändler), the most famous sculptor at the Meissen factory, and is of exceptional craftsmanship and design. The illustrious model is fitted with some truly unusual and breathtaking facets that demonstrate the exceptional quality and craftsmanship that Meissen is synonymous with. This is the best example of the Meissen Tailor that we have ever handled.

This piece was designed in the 1730s, by Johann-Joachim Kändler, and commissioned by Count Brühl, Chief Administrator to the King. The Count was known to be the most dapper person in Saxony, the old Germany. Understandably, the Count's tailor felt as though he was equally responsible for the Count's success in his sense of style. Over time, the tailor become more vain and narcissistic, to that point that he demanded the Count speak with the King and offer him a place to dine. The Count would never make any request like that to the King, and instead thought of a solution where the tailor could be at the dinner without having to ask. The Count went to Kändler and commissioned an object that looks like the tailor. Kändler was known to have a charismatic and whimsical personality and when the Count described what he wanted, Kändler put his own flair on the piece and created an ostentatious and quite humorous model of the tailor seated on an equally stylish billy goat. All in all, the Count kept his word on getting a seat for the tailor to dine with the King, except, it was the porcelain model of the tailor who was honored with the invitation. Found underneath are the signature Meissen blue crossed swords mark used for the years 1815-1924 with ""No. 107"" incised. The original design of ""Count Brühl’s Tailor on a Goat” is featured in Meissen Portrait Figures by Len and Yvonne Adams. The figurine is also featured in an original oil painting by Carl Wilhelm Anton Seiler named Count Brühl's Goat, found in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.

Hollywood Cinema’s Golden Era remains one of the most prominent influences across contemporary art and culture worldwide. Born in California in the 1920s, the Hollywood Regency style emerged from interior design: opulent, bold, and playful. Characterized by decadent adornment and palatial magnificence, Hollywood Regency furniture informed domestic design for generations. This set of gilt brass mid-century modern chest of drawers manufactured by the Mastercraft Furniture Company exemplifies the grandeur of Hollywood’s golden years and its lasting impact on art.
This pair of dressers is fashioned with three drawers for storage each. The drawer handles are formed into Chinese characters that signify the four dynasties, inside of which are lined with cedar. Strictly rectangular with strong bold lines, the dresser features both garishness and practicality—the deep gold color combines with the dresser’s form in a chic combination of luxury and utility. Descending from a long line of cabinet makers, the Doezema brothers returned from World War II and founded the Mastercraft Furniture Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1947. They set out to design sleek furniture with sophisticated industrialist elements. The company is known for their high-quality workmanship and high-value materials for products, increasing the value, quality, and workmanship of its furniture. With detail in both material and form, Mastercraft was committed to providing both aesthetic and practical quality in their furniture. After nearly 30 years in business, the brothers established a legacy of synthesizing traditional and vogue styles to create unique work characteristic of the post-war period.

This incredible bronze piece was cast after a model by Maarius-Jean-Antonin Mercié, This model is signed 'F. BARBEDIENNE FONDEUR PARIS' demonstrating that it was cast by Ferdinand Barbedienne's foundry, the best bronzier of the 19th century. The base is further signed 'A. Mercie' and stamped 'Réduction Mécanique' with an inscription of '659'. The figure is mounted on a Belgian noir marble base with various stepped edges. Gloria Victis is one the most well-known and important bronze casts of the 19th Century. The quality of this particular model is absolutely incredible and all the marking indicate that this particular piece is one of the finest produced by the Foundry.

A student of Jouffroy and de Falguière at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Marius-Jean-Antonin Mercié (1845-1916) won the Grand Prix de Rome at 23 years old with his work Thésée vainqueur du Minotaure. In 1872, he sent the plaster model of his work David vainqueur to the Salon, for which he won the first class medal. At the same time, he received La croix de la Légion d'honneur at the Villa Medici. His return to Paris, in 1874, issued in a long and brilliant career with numerous commissions, notably the monuments for Louis-Philippe and Queen Marie-Amélie for the Royal Chapel at Dreux (1886).

By the age of 30 Mercié was already very well-known and his Gloria Victis received resounding success when it was exhibited at the Salon, in 1874 (in plaster) and in 1875 (in bronze). This work exalted the heroism and the patriotic sentiments aroused by the disasters of 1870. His predilection for patriotic subjects is shown in many of his works such as Quand même, the celebrated bronze group erected at Belfort in 1884, and Jeanne d'Arc relevant l'épée de la France at Domrémy in 1902.

From 1880, Mercié began painting but it was his sculpture that won him awards and medals. In 1892, he entred L'Institut de France and in 1913, three years before his death, he was nominated as president of La Société des artistes français.",0

circa 1815-1820

This Paris porcelain ormolu-mounted casket encapsulates the lavish refinements of the Empire period. It was most probably given to a high-ranking lady as a gift on the occasion of her marriage, or perhaps after the birth of a child. The cover is inset with a Fine simulated hardstone cameo of Ceres, the Greek goddess of agriculture who was emblematic of fertility and plenty, making this casket a fitting and symbolic gift. The casket is closely related to a smaller workbox with similar ormolu mounts and cameo decoration now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The V&A example is inscribed ‘Feuillet Rue de la paix 18’ to the underside of the cover and has a contemporary Feuillet paper label to the underside. Although the present casket is considerably larger in size and finer in quality, its similarity to the V&A workbox suggests that it was assembled by Feuillet.

Jean-Pierre Feuillet (1777-1840) was a leading Parisian decorator and retailer who set up a shop in Paris on the rue de la Paix under the protection of the prince de Condé. Feuillet gained a reputation as one of the best porcelain decorators in the city and he used porcelain blanks from a variety of Parisian manufacturers including Nast and Darte Frères, supplying many aristocratic collectors. The porcelain panels used in the present casket would probably have been supplied as blanks to Feuillet, and subsequently decorated and mounted in ormolu by Feuillet, as is the case with the example in the V&A. The V&A workbox was bequeathed by Mrs. T.R.P. Hole in memory of Bettine, Lady Abingdon, and was once part of a large collection of French Empire decorative arts owned by Charles Stuart, Lord Stuart de Rothesay (1779–1845) who was the British Ambassador in France during the Napoleonic wars. It seems likely that the present casket was also intended for a similarly important collector.

The painting of trompe l’oeil cameos in imitation of hardstone cameos became a popular but technically challenging decorative technique used by many of the leading Continental porcelain factories in the late 18th and early 19th century. The technique was first used at the Sèvres manufactory in the late 18th century, but it was only truly mastered under the directorship of Alexandre Brongniart in the early 19th century. Brongniart’s training as a mineralogist could well have influenced the refinement of the technique at Sèvres. Cameos had a particular appeal to Napoleon, and he ordered vases and services painted with them, including two services called Service ‘Icongraphique’ from Sèvres painted by the artist Degault with figures from antiquity. Cameos were well adapted for Imperial propaganda, lending an antique authenticity but also alluding to the cultured fashion for classicism. Designs for such cameos were taken from Ennino-Quirino Visconti’s, Iconographie grecque, published by order of Napoleon in Paris in 1808. Visconti (1751-1818) was an Italian antiquarian and art historian, papal Prefect of Antiquities, and an expert on ancient Roman sculpture. Copies of his three volume work were given out as gifts and disseminated through Sèvres and other Parisian factories and it seems very likely that the artist who painted the Ceres cameo seen here drew inspiration from Visconti’s publication. 

Because of the technical difficulties presented by painting cameos, Feuillet most probably turned to one of the best independent decorators to supply the central cameo panel for this casket. The two most celebrated decorators specialising in this technique were Jean-Marie Degault and Louis-Bertin Parant. Of the two, Parant was the leading artist in cameo decoration; although he was employed by Sèvres to work on important commissions he was not part of the regular workforce, preferring to work independently in his own studio in Paris, decorating both Sèvres and other porcelains. Brongniart was continually frustrated at the slow progress of Parant, who was a perfectionist and had gone to great lengths to find Authentic Models for his cameo portraits. Parant’s slow progress was to benefit other accomplished artists, including Jean-Marie Degault who gained further commissions from Sèvres as a result. It is not known whether Degault worked exclusively for Sèvres, or whether he also worked as an independent decorator, but the pair of Sèvres vases ‘fuseau’ decorated by Degault and now in the Twinight Collection, New York, show a similar subtle depth of detail to each of the Emperor’s laurel crowns and the style of the calligraphy of the inscription is also close to that seen on the cameo on the present casket.",0

The first Murano glass chandeliers started production in the early 18th century. Venetian glass had been produced since the early 13th century and was renowned as the most beautiful and purest glass in the world. The glassmakers of Murano had always excelled at making beautiful and original works of art, and the transfer of their skill to chandelier production instantly bought a new dimension to the possibilities of chandelier design. Following a fall in production after the occupation of the Venetian republic by the armies of Napoleon from 1797, the mid-19th century saw a revival of Murano glass production when Venetian glass became intensely popular again.",0

Italian Marble Bust of The Grandparents, Titled: Rimembranze, Signed Vichi. 
 Presenting an exquisite Italian masterpiece from the 1800s, we have a captivating white Carrara marble bust group entitled ""Rimembranze"" (Remembrance). This remarkable sculpture portrays an endearing elderly couple locked in a tender embrace, their love emanating through the gentle touch of the man's hand on the lady's chin and face. The profound affection and mesmerizing connection between them are beautifully captured in the expressions gracing their faces.

Renowned for his exceptional talent, Ferdinando Vichi meticulously crafted this sculpture, paying meticulous attention to every detail. The couple's wrinkles, veins, and musculature, as well as the delicate rendering of their clothing and expressions, are expertly brought to life by Vichi's craftsmanship, establishing this artwork as one of his most remarkable and meticulously executed pieces. The sculpture rests on a contrasting black marble base with the title ""Rimembranze"" etched into the side, further enhancing its aesthetic appeal.

Vichi's artistry is truly captivating. The old woman's knitted shawl, meticulously fashioned out of marble, appears astonishingly lifelike, while the choice of beautiful white marble exudes a refreshing allure. The old man's playful gesture of touching the lady's chin is captured with natural grace and warmth. Vichi's exceptional ability to sculpt fabric with such finesse creates an illusion of softness that defies the medium of marble itself. The remarkable attention to detail, from the intricately carved wrinkles and smile lines to the depiction of a lifetime shared in joy, evokes a profound sense of admiration.

Ferdinando Vichi, a member of the esteemed Florentine School and associated with the Bazzanti Gallery in Florence, Italy, was part of a talented group of Tuscan sculptors. His body of work encompasses a wide range of subjects, including romantic busts, orientalist themes, and Renaissance-inspired models. Similar to his contemporaries from the late nineteenth century, Vichi often drew inspiration from romantic and tender subjects. This is exemplified in the beautifully detailed marble group depicting an elderly man's playful courtship and deep love for his wife.

This 19th-century Italian marble group titled ""Rimembranze"" is signed by the esteemed artist Ferdinando Vichi, who was associated with the renowned Pietro Barzanti gallery. Vichi's versatility extended to working with both marble and alabaster, and his repertoire included subjects ranging from the Antique to allegorical themes and Orientalism. In 1898, Vichi made a significant contribution to the memorial erected in the cathedral of Santa Croce to honor the composer Gioacchino Rossini.",0

This impressive Japanese porcelain jardiniere, hailing from the Meiji period around 1880, is a testament to the enduring allure of blue and white ceramics. A masterwork of size and craftsmanship, this jardiniere bears witness to the remarkable fusion of traditional Japanese aesthetics and symbolism.

Adorning the upper section of the jardiniere, just below the rim, is a decorative band adorned with stylized scrolls and delicate floral motifs. This ornate band pays homage to the broad rim that gracefully encircles the jardiniere's upper portion, decorated in a similar manner, accentuating the piece's cohesiveness and attention to detail.

Set against a background of white porcelain, the jardiniere's bulbous body serves as a canvas for a translucent blue and white dynamic pattern that envelops the entirety of the main bowl. Within this tapestry, a lively and delightfully expressive pack of Shishi dogs playfully interacts with wine barrels. Originating from Chinese mythology, the Shishi was embraced by Okinawans in the 15th century as protectors against malevolent spirits and misfortune. In this jardiniere, they partake in a lively play with wine barrels, symbolizing abundance and prosperity, infusing the composition with a touch of whimsy. 

Surrounding the Shishi Dogs are luxuriant, oversized peonies, stylized scrolls, and circular lattice work, creating a scene teeming with vitality and charm. The nuanced shades of translucent blue, ranging from delicate pastels to deep cobalts, imbue the artwork with depth and tonality. Notably, the peonies are brought to life through subtle gradations and intricate detailing, achieving a level of realism that is truly remarkable. The lower base of the jardiniere features a repeating pattern, depicting stylized mountain peaks. 

This jardiniere represents a harmonious union of Japanese artistry and mythology, serving as a testament to the superb craftsmanship of the Meiji period. Its fusion of cultural influences, celebration of natural beauty, and intricate design make it a treasure.",0

Rome, Circa: 1850

Giovanni Paolo Panini (Piacenza 1691-1765 Rome), View of Saint Peter's Square, Rome.
From Christie's Auction:
Giovanni Paolo Panini arrived in Rome in 1711, painting capricci and architectural pieces in a vigorous if slightly eccentric style, and by 1719, when he was admitted to the Academy of St. Luke and the virtuosi al Pantheon, he was a rising star in the Roman art world. From around 1719-1726 he was much in demand for decorative frescoes, including quadratura, ornament and landscape and other genres, often in collaboration with figure or flower painters. During this period he worked for Cardinal Patrizi at Villa Patrizi, Cardinal Annibale Albani at Palazzo Albani (now del Drago) alle Quattro Fontane, Livio de Carolis at Palazzo de Carolis, Cardinal Alberoni at Palazzo Alberoni, Innocent XIII Conti in the Quirinal and in the library of S. Croce in Gerusalemme. In 1724 he married Caterina Gosset, the sister-in-law of Nicolas Vleughels, the director of the French Academy in Rome, to which he was admitted in 1732, and as a result he was much patronized by the French. During the 1720s he developed his figure style away from the awkwardness of his early works into one that concentrated on groups of stylishly-dressed aristocrats and skillfully modelled bystanders, sibyls and pseudo-antique figures. These he noted down in drawings (such as a sketchbook in the British Museum) that he drew upon to populate his paintings. He also began to receive commissions to design and record temporary festivals, often for French ambassadors to Rome.

By the beginning of the 1730s Panini was developing a distinctive subgenre of the capriccio in which recognizable monuments are placed in imaginary topographical relationships, which were well-received in the classicizing era of Clement XII Corsini. In 1732 he was one of the panel of judges for the competition instituted by Clement for the Lateran façade, and in the following year painted an impressive View of Piazza del Quirinale for the pope. At about this time he was developing his best-known topographical subjects, interior views of St Peter's and the Pantheon, which were much in demand, to judge by the number of extant versions extending into the 1750s. By about 1734 he was beginning to attract the attention of English patrons, who ordered sets of Roman views, such as those at Marble Hill House (1738) and Castle Howard. In 1736, through Filippo Juvarra, he received important commissions from Philip V of Spain for scenes of the life of Christ in the Chinoiserie room at La Granja in Spain (1736). From as early as the 1720s he had been producing some vedute (view-paintings), initially based on prototypes by Gaspar van Wittel, and he developed the genre in subsequent decades in works that would include impressive panoramic views of the Forum or Palatine, although his staple genre was the capriccio rather than the veduta. He also expanded his repertory of church interiors, adding such churches as S. Paolo fuori le Mura and S. Agnese in Piazza Navona, as well as church interiors recording special events. His son by his first marriage, Giuseppe (1718-1805), began to support him in architectural and festival design projects.

By the 1740s Panini was at the peak of his powers, and evidently had a considerable workshop helping him meet demand, especially of capricci to be used as overdoors and other decorative installations. Giovanni Paolo was successful in elevating himself socially above the usual artisanal status of genre painters, and would sometimes include a self-portrait in paintings commissioned by the great and powerful. He also appears to have been successful financially, and owned a substantial palazzo in via Monserrato. He increasingly concentrated on important commissions, such as a view of the Lottery in Piazza Montecitorio (London, National Gallery, 1743-1744), the designs for the festival decorations for the birth of the Dauphin in Palazzo Farnese (Waddesdon Manor, 1751), or the view of an imaginary picture gallery housing the collection of Cardinal Valenti Gonzaga (Wadsworth Atheneum, 1749). In the mid-1750s he received an important series of commissions from the Duc de Choiseul, French ambassador to Rome and soon to become one of the most powerful men in France, that included his best-known compositions, Ancient Rome (Roma Antica) and Modern Rome (Roma Moderna). These large paintings, of which there are three sets (in Boston and Stuttgart, the Metropolitan Museum, and the Louvre) represent imaginary picture galleries based on the Valenti Gonzaga composition but hung with what purport to be Panini's own vedute of ancient and modern sites respectively (with corresponding pieces of sculpture). These paintings sum up the eighteenth-century canon of the greatest works of architecture and sculpture, and the equivalence between modern and ancient Rome. By this time Panini was being assisted by his son by his second marriage, Francesco (1748-1800), who was a skilled draughtsman and painter who continued his father's work after his death in 1765.

The Farnborough Hall paintings

The Piazza S. Pietro and the Campidoglio are important vedute by Panini painted in 1750 and originally installed, with other works by Panini and Canaletto, in the seat of the Holbech family, Farnborough Hall, Warwickshire (National Trust). Farnborough Hall had been inherited in 1717 by William Holbech (circa 1699-1771), who is documented on the Grand Tour in Florence, Rome and Venice from late 1732 until his return home at the end of April 1734 with his brother Hugh. Holbech is said to have gone on the Grand Tour to recover from a broken heart and to have spent a considerable time there prior to these documented appearances. During his time in Rome he acquired two Paninis, which were seen by an anonymous antiquary around 1746, who referred to various sculptures ""all brought from Rome with two pictures, one of the Rotunda, and the other of diverse buildings by Panino"" (British Library, Add. MS 6230, pp. 31-32). The Rotunda (the Pantheon) is a painting now in a private collection in New York, and is signed and dated 1734. The Diverse Buildings, which was probably one of Panini's capricci, has not been identified. On his Grand Tour Holbech seems also to have acquired two Canalettos, although they are not mentioned by the antiquary, who may only have had eyes for things Roman.

In about 1746-1747, Holbech remodelled the house by creating a Saloon, now the dining room, at the back of the house. This room, the entrance hall, the staircase, library and closet were stuccoed by William Perritt of York, and a bill for this work dated 14 November 1750 survives (or survived until recently; G. Beard, Decorative Plasterwork in Great Britain, London, 1975, p. 233). The two Canalettos acquired on the Grand Tour were installed in the Saloon, together with two new works commissioned from Canaletto, who was then in England and working nearby at Warwick Castle in 1748. The two Paninis acquired on the Grand Tour may have been installed in the Library, as Alastair Laing assumes (op. cit.), while three new works commissioned from Panini in Rome were placed in the Hall and Saloon: the Piazza S. Pietro for the overmantel in the Hall (fig. 1), the Campidoglio as the overmantel in the Saloon (fig. 2), and an Interior of St Peter's (now in Detroit) (fig. 3) on the adjacent wall facing the windows. Two of the Canalettos flanked the Campidoglio, while the others were on the opposite wall. The Interior of St Peter's was therefore effectively the fifth member of the Canaletto set, distinct from the two overmantels.

Holbech's installation of his Canalettos and Paninis in fixed stucco frames was unusual for England in 1750, and had probably been inspired by what he had seen on his Grand Tour in Northern Italy, where fixed stucco installations of canvases were common in the 1720s and 1730s (Cornforth, II, p. 51). The Campidoglio and the Interior of St Peter's are both signed and dated 1750, a date that corresponds to the payments for the stucco.

The commission for the new Paninis would have been made through an agent, possibly the Roman dealer in antiquities Belisario Amidei from whom some of the antique busts in the Hall were acquired in 1745, who was also a picture dealer; or perhaps the painter Pietro Berton, who on 7 December 1750 shipped a Panini to England.

The paintings were sold to Savile Gallery in 1929 and replaced by copies by one Mohammed Ayoub. The four Canalettos were exhibited at Savile Gallery in 1930 and entered the London art trade, finding their way at various times to Augsburg, Melbourne, Ottawa and a private collection. The Paninis seem to have been resold immediately to Knoedler & Co. in New York. When the stucco was removed from the library by Holbech's great-grandson, another William Holbech, shortly after his succession in 1812, the Interior of the Pantheon and the Diverse Buildings may have been taken down. Although there is no record of either painting being at Farnborough subsequently, the Interior of the Pantheon at least must have remained there, since it appeared at Knoedler's in 1930 at about the same time as the other Paninis, and was presumably acquired at the same time from the same source.

The Campidoglio was a rare subject for Panini: this is the only known extant version, apart from fictive versions in the Metropolitan Museum (1757) (figs. 4) and Louvre (1759) versions of his Roma Moderna composition (but not in the first Boston version of 1757). Probably Holbech insisted on the choice of subject in order to represent the centre of Rome's civic administration to complement the religious one of St Peter's. The Campidoglio may have been of interest to English patrons because it represented the seat of a form of government they were more comfortable with than the papacy. For example, Canaletto painted the subject, together with English subjects, for Thomas Hollis, 'the most bigoted of all Republicans' in 1755, who may have wanted to 'represent London as the heir to the legacy of Ancient Rome and Renaissance Italy' (see Michael Liversidge and Jane Farrington, eds., Canaletto and England, exhibition catalogue, Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery, London, 1993, p. 25). Canaletto also painted the subject for Sir Richard Neave, Ist Baronet (1731-1814) of Dagnam Park, Essex, at the end of his English stay or shortly afterwards (i.e. 1755-1766) (sold, Sotheby's, London, 10 July 2002, lot 8). Like Holbech, Neave mixed Venetian and Roman subjects, but his Roman subjects steer clear of St Peter's: the others were the Piazza del Quirinale and Piazza Navona. While Holbech had gone to both Venice and Rome and commissioned views of both cities, Rome sets the keynote for his decoration: antique busts line the Hall, and its religious and civic centres are the overmantels in the Hall and Saloon respectively.

The Piazza S. Pietro

The Piazza S. Pietro shows the piazza much as it appears today, apart from the absence of Valadier's late eighteenth-century clocks on the towers. Bernini's colonnade (1656-1667), both ends of which are visible, reaches out its arms to embrace the viewer. In the center of the piazza is the obelisk moved by Sixtus V in 1586 from the left side of the church where it had formed part of the Circus of Nero. On either side are two fountains, the one on the right by Carlo Maderno (1613) and the one on the left created to match it by Carlo Fontana in 1677. Beyond is the rectangular forecourt to the church, the piazza retta, leading to the façade by Maderno, completed in 1610, and the dome by Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana. To the right of the façade the roof of the Sistine Chapel is just visible, followed by the Cortile di S. Damaso, the palace of the Swiss Guards and the palace of Paul V. A Cardinal is being driven in a carriage across the piazza at the right in the direction of the Borgo Nuovo and Ponte S. Angelo with his blue-liveried retinue and subsidiary carriages. Unlike the later versions of the subject that depict the Duke de Choiseul, there seems to be no intent to portray any particular cardinal: the procession of a cardinal here is presented simply as characteristic activity within the piazza. Various groups of figures, including well-dressed women in brightly colored dresses, Swiss Guards, priests, gentlemen, idlers and a pilgrim are distributed around the piazza. In the foreground an imaginary heap of fallen masonry provides visual interest in an otherwise dead space.

Panini painted the Piazza S. Pietro on a number of occasions, and his works falls into two types, one with the viewpoint shifted slightly to left of the axis, as in the Farnborough Hall version, and one with it shifted slightly to the right. The first type is based on a composition by Gaspar van Wittel, of which there are numerous versions from 1684 until 1721 (Fig. 9 van Wittel). The work by Panini that seems closest to Van Wittel and therefore probably the earliest is the version in the Circolo della Caccia, Rome, which has been dated to the second half of the 1730s, but is probably a decade or so earlier. Another, on the London art market in 2002-2009, and a version with workshop participation at Sotheby's, Milan (20 November 2007, lot 137) and currently on the art market in Rome, are closer to an important painting in Toledo (Arisi no. 308) that is signed and dated 1741 (fig. 6).

Van Wittel employed a wide format (about 2:1), showed both of the end faces of the colonnade almost to their full extent, and introduced the theme of a heap of masonry to enliven the foreground. His choice of perspective implies a viewpoint located in the small piazza between the Borgo Nuovo and Borgo Vecchio, now the Piazza Pio XII at the top of the Via della Conciliazione. From this viewpoint a building at the left tended to interfere with the view of the end of the left arm, as can be seen from the Nolli map of 1748 (fig. 7) and Piranesi's etching of circa 1646-1648 where, in contrast to the Van Wittel-Panini tradition, the obelisk and center of the façade of St. Peter's are aligned (fig. 8). This is why in Van Wittel's paintings and in the Paninis closest to them there is a glimpse of the building on the corner of the Borgo Vecchio on the left. Another detail found in Van Wittel and the associated Paninis, including the Farnborough Hall picture, is what seems to be four bollards protecting a drain to the right of the right-hand fountain. In Van Wittel's painting, however, there is a drinking trough for horses nearby, which by Panini's day had been relocated to the small piazza between the Borgo Nuovo and Borgo Vecchio as can be seen in the Nolli map.

The Toledo picture shows Panini attempting to adapt the wide Van Wittel format to a less elongated format by extending the foreground and sky and cropping the left side, a process extended further in the Farnborough Hall version, where the field is almost square (as was presumably specified by Holbech and the stuccatore Perritt). As if recognizing the limits of adapting the Van Wittel composition to squarer formats, in 1754 Panini developed the second type with the viewpoint shifted to the right, which has the effect of bringing the end of the right arm of the colonnade under the palace of Paul V and creating a more dynamic composition. Nonetheless, he reverted to the first type for the large painting in the Duke of Sutherland collection (circa 1756-1757, Arisi no. 472) and in the fictive canvas in the three versions of the Roma Moderna composition.

The Campidoglio

The Campidoglio shows, from the right, the Palazzo dei Conservatori (no. 919 on Nolli's 1748 map, fig. 9), remodelled by Michelangelo from 1538, the Palazzo del Senatore (Nolli 920), remodelled by Michelangelo at the same time, and the Palazzo Nuovo (Nolli 918), completed to Michelangelo's design in the 1650s and 1660s. Between the Palazzo Senatorio and Palazzo Nuovo is a glimpse of the dome of Pietro da Cortona's SS. Luca e Martina. In the center of the piazza is the statue of Marcus Aurelius, installed there in 1538, with the surviving traces of its gilding emphasized to help it compete for attention with the colossal statues of the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux) with their horses on the balustrade. These came from the Temple of Castor and Pollux beside the Circus Flaminius and had been dug up in about 1560 and installed on the balustrade in 1585 and 1590, together with the statues of trophies known as the Trofei di Mario (Trophies of Marius) from a triumphal arch of Domitian that had been reused for the Nymphaeum of Alexander Severus. On either side are two statues found on the Quirinal in 1635, Constantine the Great on the left and his son Constantine II on the right. At the ends of the balustrades are two milestones from the via Appia, the one on the left marking the seventh mile and the one on the right marking the first. Between the Dioscuri rises the cordonata, a pedestrian and horse ramp linking the Piazza d'Aracoeli to the Campidoglio, flanked at the bottom by two fountains created in 1587-1588 from two Egyptian crouching lions in black granite from the Temple of Isis in the Campo Marzio.

Canaletto based his views of the Campidoglio closely on Alessandro Specchi's engraving of 1692 (fig. 10), and Panini does so as well, which may seem surprising, since he, unlike Canaletto, was on the spot, but it was generally easier for vedutisti to start from an existing engraving if there was one. That Specchi was the source for both artists is demonstrated by the way the carriage ramp on the right, which did exist, is mirrored by one on the left, which did not. The right-hand ramp was remodelled in this form during the reign of Innocent XII (1691-1700) by Filippo Tittoni (1645-1713), who preceded Specchi as architetto del Popolo Romano (architect to the 'Roman People', i.e., the Campidoglio). The previous ramp was straight and clearly presented a problem for carriages which had to turn at ninety degrees at the bottom against the side of the cordonata, a problem eased by curving the mouth of the ramp. The ramp on the left, however, could never have been built without demolishing much of the staircase of S. Maria in Aracoeli, so Specchi presumably introduced it as a way of idealizing an image that glorified the Campidoglio and cleaned up what would have been an awkward junction with the steps of the Aracoeli staircase. The executed right-hand ramp was known as the Via dei Tre Pile, 'pile' being Romanesco dialect for the pots of the Pignatelli coat of arms that appear on top of the pedestal ornaments at the beginning of the ramp.

At the bottom right Panini shows a building that corresponds to the Ospizio de' Geronimi di S. Alessio (Nolli 983), which is also shown by Specchi and in Vasi's 1754 engraving. It has banded pilasters, an arched doorway, two stringcourses and an attic window below a low tiled roof. One difference is the fact that the pilasters in Panini are double, whereas those in Specchi and Vasi are single. This is probably an aesthetic choice by Panini: in his Charles III visiting Benedict XIV in the Quirinal Caffeaus (Arisi, no. 368) he also doubles the pilasters of Ferdindano Fuga's Caffeaus in an otherwise factual representation. Attached to this building is a short section of wall enclosing a small garden, and there is space between this wall and the parapet wall of the Campidoglio. According to Specchi and Vasi there was no such space, as is confirmed by Nolli's map of 1748. These details must be Panini's invention, prompted by the awkward junction of building and ramp.

On the façade of the Palazzo Senatorio, Panini depicts round disks bearing coats-of-arms on either side of the central bay of the Palazzo Senatorio. These do not appear in any other eighteenth-century representations, including Specchi, Vasi and Piranesi's near-contemporary view (1746-1748), but similar armorial disks are found in a drawing by Lievin Cruyl of 1665 (engraved in editions published in 1666 and 1689). Evidently such coats-of-arms were placed there on occasion, and the fact that Panini chose to show them may indicate a desire to heighten the ceremonial significance of the building; they also provide useful color accents. However, the framing surrounding the inscription above the central doorway bears only a casual relationship to the actual framing, suggesting he was interpreting the hints given by Specchi in his own architectural style.

Although Panini's point of departure was Specchi's print, he redrew the composition in a perspective better suited to his own purpose, as was customary for view-painters. He shifted the Palazzo Senatorio almost to the center of the composition, lowered the horizon line from the level of the top of the steps of the Palazzo Senatorio to the bottom, and shifted the vanishing point a little to the left. He reduced the foreshortening on the Palazzo Nuovo, but probably by more than he should have: having placed the horizon at ground level it was easy to make such adjustments without being too strict in the perspective construction. This shift in vanishing point should not have had the effect of making the cordonata converge in a fanlike way from left and right, rather than from the left as in Specchi, and Panini seems to have made this change to create a more energetic composition, where the three main components -- cordonata, Palazzo Nuovo and Palazzo dei Conservatori -- all converge steeply toward the scenographic backdrop of the Palazzo Senatorio. This is combined with a subtle asymmetry emphasized by the shifted positions of the Dioscuri relative to the Palazzo Senatorio, and the glimpse of the above-mentioned building at the right.

As a result of these changes, the cordonata becomes the main field of interest, allowing Panini to distribute across it his characteristic repertory of (underscaled) figures. Panini has in fact reconfigured the cordonata as a kind of Scalinata di Spagna (Spanish Steps), which he would represent a few years later in 1756-1758 in a drawing in the Metropolitan Museum. The cordonata was in reality never so broad, nor so suitable a space for social interaction: it was and is primarily the means for getting from the Piazza di Aracoeli to the Piazza del Campidoglio.",0

Similarly, the sun-shaped pendulum nods to Louis XIV’s reign as the “Sun King.”   Imperial power was conveyed in lavishly decorated home furnishings—consolidating political and economic capital in quotidian household items.

Reference: The Peter Marino Collection, Theodore Deck, Page 79.

Joseph-Théodore Deck was born in 1823 in Guebwiller in Alsace. He dreamed to become a sculptor but his humble origins oriented him towards a more prosaic profession: ceramic potter. He learned the technique of ceramics as a manufacturer of covered ovens with ceramic tiles and traveled to Germany, Hungary and Austria to improve his skills. At the age of 24, he moved to Paris to practice his art and worked in a factory that made ceramic kilns. He opened his own earthenware workshop in 1856 with his brother and his nephew and specialized in the oriental style and more particularly in the Iznik style. In the 1880s he explored the Chinese tradition and collaborated with Raphaël Collin, an academic painter professor at the Academy of Fine Arts recognized for the links he forged between French art and Japanese art both in painting. and ceramic. He published a treatise on the art of earthenware in 1887.He died in Paris in 1891.
Deck's contemporary sculptors and painters made frequent visits to the Deck workshop, which thus became an experimental laboratory to promote ceramics as an art and no longer simply as an industrial application. It was while attending the National Porcelain Museum in Sèvres that Deck studied Islamic art. Deck discovered that the brilliance of oriental ceramics was due to an alkaline base containing tin oxide. The decorations are covered with a transparent coating which produces a shiny and translucent effect. After many trials and experiments, Deck succeeded in perfecting this technique and created Deck Blue, his famous turquoise-blue using potash, soda ash and chalk. Deck presented his first collection of louvered earthenware at the Paris Exhibition of 1861 but it was at the London Exhibition of 1862 that he was officially recognized as an artist when the Victoria and Albert Museum bought three of his works. . He received a silver medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1867. Deck copied many Iznik ceramics but also created his own variations around the oriental theme by assembling various patterns on a single work.",0

In late 1739-early 1740 the Sèvres Porcelain factory opened in the Royal Château of Vincennes, 16 years later in 1756 the factory moved to the village of Sèvres located outside of Paris and in route to Louis XV's Palace of Versailles where it became the preeminent porcelain manufacturer in Europe. When the company ran into financial difficulties, the King who had become an avid client bought out the shareholders and became the sole owner. The factory remained in the royal family until it was nationalized following the French Revolution. 

The range of objects produced in the first half of the 19th century was enormous, as were the types of decoration that they employed. The Sèvres factory produced ninety-two new designs for vases. The factory is still in production today.",0

This is the rarest and most impressive piece done by Genryusai Seiya. This is most probably his masterpiece and one of the most salient pieces he ever produced. After Five Generations in this business, we have never seen another jardinière by Genryusai Seiya in this particular model/subject. The jardinière rests on a round base in the form of flowing water, which is significant to the upper rounded vessel portion which depicts a boat. The boat is most probably riding on the Great Lake Biwa, which is noted as the largest ancient freshwater lake in Japan. The lake is thought to be approximately 4 million years old and holds great significance to culture, literature, and the environment of Japan. 

The Jardinière is made up of one continuous patinated bronze cast with very high and low relief subjects. The passengers of this boat range from a elderly fisherman, to a woman with her child, to woman in a kimono, and many more. Each ultra-high relief figure is hand-chiseled with the utmost quality and detail, no other piece can compare in perfection. The faces, hands, hair, and objects each person holds are so perfectly constructed that they seem absolutely real. 

Fine Japanese art is known to be top-quality, but this piece is exceptional, with the most impressive dark black patina over an illustrious extremally well developed bronze body. Each person on the jardinière has a story, each is on the boat for a particular reason heading to an important place. Genryusai Seiya created this piece to spark the creative expression of anyone who sees it. The individuals each share a different life, which is presented differently to anyone that views it. This creative inspiration that is evoked person to person demonstrates how prolific Genryusai Seiya is as an artist. His works are truly perfect and this is piece the culmination to all this masterpieces. A picture speaks a thousand words, but a piece of art in bronze has an endless amount of stories to be told. The Japanese are known as a people of excellence, mannerism, creativity, and perfection. This piece encompasses all those ideas and more.

Introduced at Meissen in the early 1700s in monochrome red or blue, the 'Dragon' pattern is thought to have been inspired by a Japanese porcelain prototype. It in turn incorporating Chinese symbols, such as the dragon, sparring phoenix and ribbon-tied precious objects. In addition to pieces made for the Royal Court at Dresden, a substantial quantity of Meissen porcelain in the Chinese and Japanese style was made around 1729-31 for the French merchant, Lemaire. In 1733, much of this early production was confiscated and later transferred to the Dresden Japanese Palace of Augustus Rex. The pattern was much admired at the Saxon court and was subsequently produced for its exclusive use. Those destined for the Royal Saxon Court Confectioner’s or the ‘Ko¨nigliche-Hof-Conditorei’ were initialed on the underside with a distinctive K.H.C. mark. In the 19th and 20th century, alongside the Asian inspired ‘Blue Onion’ pattern, the ‘Dragon’ decor grew to be one of the most popular patterns produced at Meissen. A variety of monochrome and polychrome examples were made, the ‘Rich Golden Dragon’ being one of the most coveted.

A Meissen porcelain figure from the Love Series: Cupid Mailing a Love Letter with a Love Bird. Circa 1870, this piece epitomizes the finest quality in terms of craftsmanship, painting, and colors. In excellent condition, this absolutely beautiful creation showcases a finely painted chubby cupid with a gorgeously detailed face.

The cupid's features include lovely clear blue eyes and curly hair, meticulously rendered with hand-painted strands in curls, displaying a rich chestnut brown hue. A powder blue ribbon adorns his head like a band. His wings, all aflutter on his back, reveal exquisite detailing in the form and hand-painted nuances of each feather.

Standing atop a highly naturalistic hand-painted ground, the cupid is surrounded by intricate foliate and a beautiful unfurling flower, while leaning on a meticulously rendered tree stump. Draped in a swath of lemon yellow fabric that billows out behind him, Cupid is poised with charm. In his left hand, he cradles a beautiful plump pink flaming heart, while his right hand proudly holds up high a delicately painted dove with wings outstretched, bearing a love letter tied about its neck and chest.

Adding to the cupid's ensemble is a delicate pale pink and gilt sash, securing a khaki green gilt-trimmed quiver containing a finely painted trio of arrows in red, blue, and magenta. The cupid's feet are intricately detailed, with each toenail visible and realistic toning in the flesh throughout his entire body.

The facial features of Cupid are truly sublime, with a beautiful flushed face and an expression that captures the essence of love. The blue and white crossed swords mark of Meissen is clearly present on the round gilt-banded base, attesting to the authenticity and prestige of this exceptional piece. ",0

This is truly an awe inspiring one of a kind piece made by ""The Modern Day Faberge"" Manfred Wild. The ships haul is made from a single clear hand carved piece of rock crystal. The top of the rock crystal haul is hand-engraved and further etched to appear as if it is made up of individual wooden planks. The ship also consists of two hand carved frosted rock crystal sails, each delicately floating in mid-air and held up by 18-karat gold chains and bars. The ships body is made up of pieces of solid two-tone matte and burnished 18-karat yellow gold, all hand-chased and further chiseled with exceptional detail and the highest quality of craftsmanship. Around either end of the ship are twenty-eight green enamel shields, each with a particular engraved design, and fitted with interchanging bezel-set round sapphire and diamond cabochons. There are two banks of twenty-six Romanesque oars on either side of the galley constructed of solid 18-karat yellow gold. To complete the rowing capacity of the galley, two complimentary solid 18-karat yellow gold and patinated gold rudders can be found on the stern, starboard and port sides. On the stern or back side of the boat is a rounded semi-circular fine-silver dome, decorated in brown enamel with a teardrop shaped emerald finial. A gold winged end is also affixed to the stern with a gold Romanesque finial further enhanced with a gold-beveled circular emerald. Attached to the beveled-emerald are four gold spurs, each with gold-beveled sapphires. Located throughout the galley are over 650 brilliant- cut diamonds, which have been meticulously set in the gold body. The top sail rests on a patinated rod with gold chain-links which attach the sail to the brown enameled stern. An anchor completes the gorgeous Roman galley and demonstrates the care and exceptionally quality of this piece. The entire galley is mounted on a gorgeous black quartzite base set in 18-karat gold. Located in the photos is a document provided by Emil Becker/Manfred Wild explaining every key detail about this Roman galley. There are only two of these Roman galleys in existence. One is in a museum and the other is available for purchase.
According to the document there are 28 green enamel-shields on 18-karat gold 750, three sections of brown enamel on fine-silver, 6 sapphire-cabouchons drops at 3.58-carat., 20 sapphire-cabouchons round at 3.79-carat., 1 emerald-cabouchon drop at 1.17-carat., 1 emerald pampel at 2.31-carat., 2 emerald cabouchons 8 mm. round at 4.97-carat., 11 emerald carres facettet at 2.18-carat., 652 diamonds twvsi at 7.06-carat., 8 diamond-rose-cuts at 1.01-carat., and approximately 1,500 working hours to complete this Museum-Quality masterpiece. According to Wild, the galley consists of 1,620 grams of 18-karat 750 gold, in total, and has a total weight of 14,210 grams, including the base.

According to Museum Collection,
""Manfred Wild is a lapidary artist and jeweler. [He] was born in 1944 in Kirshvayler near the city of Idar-Oberstein. ?? is the eighth representative of the family dynasty that has been engaged in lapidary art since 1630.

Being born in [an] creative environment, since his boyhood Manfred was keen on painting. Besides the educational school, he graduated from the Art and Commercial college. When he was rather young, Wild started his own business together with his wife Ute, the granddaughter of Emil Becker - the owner of the well-known stone-cutting workshop. Originally, Wild’s manufacture specialized on creating copies of the well-known art objects, but as the time passed, it fully switched off to the designed items production.

Manfred Wild is sometimes called “The 21st century Faberge”. This comparison is quite reasonable. He managed not only to capture the delicate technology of stone and metal processing, but to create his own recognizable style as well, having carefully rendered the best skills and techniques of the greatest artisans of the past.

The author’s works are exhibited in the world largest museums and galleries, such as The Gemstones museum in Idar-Oberstein, Harvard museum in Boston, Jewelry art museum in Korea. Besides, Wild’s works are the dreamed exhibits for private collectors all over the world"".

Drawing inspiration from the renowned ""Bust of Alexander the Great (356-323 BC)"" housed in the esteemed Palace of Versailles, this monumental work of art showcases exceptional craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail, serving as a testament to the creator's artistic prowess.

Central to this magnificent sculpture is the resplendent red marble face, neck, and hair of Alexander the Great. Capturing the youthful essence of the conqueror, the sculptor depicts him as a young man with a clean-shaven countenance, his moderately long curls delicately cascading from beneath a remarkably unadorned helmet, save for a magnificent plume. The red marble harmoniously accentuates the life-like features of Alexander, imparting an air of regal elegance to the composition.

Adding to the allure of this remarkable sculpture is an ormolu robe cascading over Alexander's shoulders, exuding an aura of nobility and power. Of particular note, the breastplate bears an embossed ormolu mask of a deity in profile, surrounded by elegantly sweeping acanthus leaves, paying homage to the influential forces that shaped the life of this great conqueror. Once again, the sublime combination of precious metal and marble amplifies the robe's magnificence, further accentuated by the presence of an ormolu body chain swaying gracefully from Alexander's left shoulder to his right hip.

The selection of marbles for the cuirass and plinth serves as an additional testament to the artist's commitment to crafting a visually striking and harmonious composition. The grey marble cuirass complements the overall color scheme of the bust while providing a subtle contrast to the red marble features. At the neck, a pleated ormolu linen undergarment discreetly peeks out, showcasing the artist's meticulous attention to intricate details and enhancing the sculpture's depth.  The original Alexander The Great Bust is housed within the esteemed Palace of Versailles, it serves as a compelling homage to the extraordinary achievements and indelible impact of one of history's most renowned figures.

The original bust consists of provenance from the former collection of Cardinal de Richelieu. Given by the Duchess of Aiguillon, niece of the cardinal, to Francois Girardon who restored it and completed it with an armor of green veined marble from Egypt and gilded bronze. Purchased in 1715 by the Duc d'Estrées. Purchased in 1738 by the Comte de Maurepas on behalf of Louis XV and placed in the Cabinet du Conseil. Deposit of the Louvre museum in Versailles in 1953.",0

Sundblom et al., Porfyr, exhibition catalogue, December 1985-February 1986, p.31). A vase of the same shape and size in Blyberg porphyry was also included in this Exhibition (no. 24). Älvdalen (Elfdal) in Sweden appears to have been the only place in Europe since Antiquity where porphyry has been mined seriously. Mining started in the 1780s and the works were bought by Charles XIV, the first of the Bernadotte Kings of Sweden, in order to realize Bernadotte's ambition to bring the splendour of the French Empire style to Sweden. During this period many items in porphyry were distributed throughout Europe as diplomatic presents and sold by the Royal Family in 1856. The works were destroyed by fire ten years later and subsequent production was sporadic and limited.

These beautiful ormolu-mounted white marble cassolettes are by Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) and John Fothergill (1730- circa 1782) published in their Pattern Book No. 1 (page 171, figure t) and reproduced in Sir Nicholas Goodison's Ormolu: The Work of Matthew Boulton (New York, 1974, page 383, figure 161).

Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) was a close friend of Boulton's and his patterns are thought to be the source for the medallions used on the plinths of these. Boulton's medallions of classical figures are almost identical to the cameos and intaglios made by Wedgwood and his partner James Tassie.

Molds for these examples can be found in the Wedgwood Collection at the Victoria & Albert Museum. All derive from the same classical source of Renaissance gems. Many gem collections in Europe were widely published at this time and Boulton's library contained A. F. Gori's Museum Florentinum (1731-1766), in which gems from the Medici collection were engraved.

The subjects of the medallions on this pair are: Pomona, a Roman goddess of fruit trees, gardens, and orchards, and depicted carrying a basket on her head overloaded with fruit, tumbling to the ground, shown once on each vase.  Hygeia, once on each, with an olive branch in her right hand, as seen in Tassie's reproduction of Valerio Belli's gem, and holding a snake in her left hand over an altar. This was produced by Wedgwood both as an intaglio and as a cameo.  Venus & Cupid, only on one vase, showing Venus leaning against a column with a pike, and giving a helmet to Cupid. Aesclepius, Greek GD of medicine, only on one vase, depicted with a snake wrapped around his staff .The last medallion subject is either Diomedes or Perseus, shown once on each vase, depicted as a conquering hero.  Boulton asked patrons to choose from a limited repertoire of motifs, and therefore each vase or pair of vases is adorned with their own combination. Boulton used nine medallion subjects on recorded vases of this type.


PROVENANCE & COMPS

Another pair of this model, with slightly less elaborate lids and finials, from a private collection are illustrated in Goodison's Matthew Boulton: ORMOLU, (page 379, figure 153). A further example is in a private New York collection. This pair, which was acquired from Hotspur in 1981, was formerly in the Collection of Marjorie Wiggin Prescott, sold Christie’s, New York, 31 January 1981, lot 76. The Prescott Collection was one of the most important English furniture collections of its time. The sale consisted mostly of late 17th and 18th century English furniture ranging from rare early stumpwork pieces, hangings and other small objects, to some exquisite piece of Georgian walnut and mahogany furniture, including several previously in the Percival Griffiths Collection.  A similar pair sold at Christies Auction 7821 THE BARRATT COLLECTION - FROM CROWE HALL, BATH, for 115,250 British Pounds, equivalent to $180,000 USD.  Another pair sold at Christies Auction, 50 YEARS OF COLLECTING:DECORATIVE ARTS OF GEORGIAN ENGLAND, in 2003, for 201,250 British Pounds, equivalent to $326,025 USD.  These are just a few examples out of many more that demonstrate the magnificent and importance of these museum quality cassolettes.

These tureens show the combination of iconic French and German porcelain trends.  Produced by Meissen under the direction of Marcolini, these tureens come from a period when porcelain production was at its peak. Count Camillo Marcolini became the director of the Meissen Porcelain Factory in 1774. During his tenure domestic German porcelain flourished in popularity when political strife restricted imports from neighboring European countries. Porcelains from this era remain some of the finest and most iconic in history. 

This set of mounted tureens is decorated with hand-painted scenes of townspeople gathering to socialize. Atop the tureen is a seated putto, indicating the joyful leisure present on the tourine’s frieze.  Surrounding the porcelain is a gilt bronze rim, handles, and stand. The porcelain bodies are mounted on ormolu plinths with four lion paws.

The porcelain elements—primarily the painting on the frieze—are distinctly German, while the ormolu elements are French. Utilizing the surface of the porcelain to depict the hum and haw of village people is typical of German painting, which has culturally taken a more democratic approach to artistic provocations. The French elements, on the other hand, are far more ostentatious and opulent. The flashy ormolu mount and lion’s feet solidify the French imperial design sensibilities, while the subtle painted social commentary continues the history of German sociological inquiry.

Step into an era where Meissen porcelain meets French doré bronze in a harmonious blend of artistry and elegance. These 3-light candelabras, each a testament to the skill of their creators, stand as a magnificent display of art and function.

A striking feature of these candelabras is the meticulously handcrafted, fine, multicolored porcelain flowers that appear fresh and vibrant, adorning the ormolu lattice structure. Each delicate petal is attached to the main frame with gilt stems, artfully fashioned in a naturalistic manner. The result is an enchanting arrangement that appears to be growing unhindered from a garden below.

The naturalistic theme extends to the candle holders themselves, with each one adorned with leaves that gracefully wrap around the main body of the candle cup. Below the candle cup, the design continues with doré bronze and hand-carved leaves that fan out in a graceful flourish, not only enhancing the visual appeal but also serving a practical purpose.

What truly sets these candelabras apart is the addition of finely crafted and painted Meissen porcelain figures. Two alluring Meissen women, one with raven-black hair and the other with pale tresses, are captured, their torsos loosely draped in porcelain, meticulously sculpted and hand-painted to resemble fresh floral fabrics.

One of the figures holds newly cut and tied wheat and a scythe, symbolizing the bountiful harvest, while the other cradles a basket brimming with freshly picked flowers, evoking the beauty of nature. Both figures are elegantly elevated as if standing within tall pedestals.

This pair of candelabras is a testament to the level of artistry and attention to detail that characterized the 18th century, where fine Meissen porcelain, intricate ormolu metalwork, and exquisite design converged to create objects of enduring beauty and sophistication.",0

The dore bronze tops are acorn finials, which are sandwiched between two rock crystal prisms with acanthus leaf dore bronze holders. Each candelabra body is hand carved and hand-polished from a large and very clear piece of natural rock crystal, which has been mounted to multiple dore bronze candle arms. The long dore bronze arms are very unusual, they swirl from the body to the candle holders and are each burnished and hand-chassed. The candle holders are decorated with wreaths in relief which are matte and burnished creating a 3-dimentional effect to the lights. The bobeches are equally beautiful and are cast in the form of acanthus leaves with grapes which hang off the sides. Decorated on each bobeche are clear rock crystal and amethyst crystals which dangle around the circumference of the bobeches.

These extraordinary pieces serve as a testament to the epitome of artistic mastery, meticulously crafted by the esteemed Alfred Beurdeley. They belong to a limited series known as the 'Aux Autruches' collection, named after the original masterpiece designed by the illustrious François Rémond in the 1700s. Emmanuel Alfred Beurdeley, also known as Alfred II (1847-1919), faithfully produced a series of commissioned candelabra featuring enchanting ostrich motifs. It is noteworthy that the original creation from this collection by François Rémond currently resides in the Palace of Versailles. 

The magnificent and rare candelabra showcase intricate hand-chased and hand-chiseled workmanship. Boasting seven candle arms adorned with ormolu foliate motifs, gracefully twisted and embellished with naturalistic acanthus leaves, flowers, and berries. The cups at the ends of the arms are adorned with elaborate banded filigree edged bobeches, radiating timeless beauty and refinement.

What is truly beautiful are the meticulously hand-chased and hand-chiseled patinated bronze ostriches, which exhibit an astonishing level of detail and life-like appearance. The majestic ostriches exude elegance as they seemingly support the circular ormolu mid flare beneath the primary arms of the candelabra. Their heads are adorned with an openwork ormolu decoration of enchanting tassels and pearls that create a cascading and interlacing effect. They stand resolutely atop a splendid round ormolu plinth accentuated by draperies, bows, stars, and a rush, exuding the distinctive charm of the Louis XVI style.

François Rémond established himself as one of the finest bronziers, rivaling even his esteemed elder, Thomire. In terms of historical significance, the original ostrich candelabra were initially delivered in 1782 to the second Turkish Cabinet of the Comte d'Artois at Versailles. Subsequently, they were confiscated during the Revolution and preserved by the Temporary Arts Commission in 1794. Later, they were transferred to the Hôtel de l'Infantado in Paris by the end of 1795. Noteworthy mentions include their presence in the Tuileries, the Empress's apartment in 1807, the Grand Cabinet of the Emperor in 1810, the sacristy of the chapel in 1816, the King's waiting room in 1833, and the Salon du Conseil in 1855.

Crystal orbs have been used by the occult since the European Iron Age. Psychics, sorcerers, and shamans drew insights and predictions from orbs as a source of divine knowledge and to receive positive energy. Many pre-industrial cultures practiced crystal gazing throughout history, but the Druids originated what we now associate with crystal balls. After the disappearance of the occult Druids in the 7th century CE, crystal reading fell out of practice in Europe. It was not until interest in paganism and occult knowledge emerged in the Renaissance that crystal orbs resurfaced and gained cultural prominence.

Porphyry is an exceptionally durable stone, which obtained its antiquity name from its rich red color, that is speckled with white accents. Porphyry is similar to the purple color called purpura by the Romans. Over the course of trade and barter, the name reached the massif where porphyry was quarried in Egypt, where the Romans adopted and called Mons Porphyrites. 
During the first century B.C., the Romans quarried porphyry, using and excavating the stone in such large quantities that it was almost entirely used. The exceptional stone began to be used for monumental reasons, gaining an Imperial Symbol, due to its analogy with Roman purpura, which had been the signified with regal dignity. Porphyry use was limited by Emporer Diocletian to the Imperial family. The onerous task of sculpting masterpieces with this stone has forever been lost, only to see such works of art from past-times.

F. Caldwell and Co New York. In the Empire style, the circular pierced frieze decorated with swans and anthemia above a ribbon-entwined floral border, on four paw-footed supports, each with a metal plaque engraved Georges A Glaenzer & Co. 1891. These unique torcheres are easily attributable to the NY maker E. F. Caldwell and Co, New York, retailed by Georges A. Glaenzer & Co., New York, dated 1891.

Born in Paris, interior decorator Georges A. Glaenzer (d.1915) was a member of the French Commission at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Returning to the United States in 1880, he worked for such illustrious clientele such as the Vanderbilts and John D. Archbold. In the late 1880s, he contributed his talents to the construction of the Vanderbilt mansion in Hyde Park, New York, joining the ranks of such notables as architect Stanford White and lighting designer Edward F. Caldwell who catered exclusively to America’s elite. The decorator undoubtedly favored the Empire style, having dove-tailed original period furnishings from Napoleon's former château Malmaison with late 19th century replicas in the overall opulent design of the country residence. Between 1891 and 1894, Glaenzer oversaw the interior decoration of the New York townhouse of Joseph A. Taft, again incorporating revival decorations such as these Torcheres, (dated 1891) with those of the great designers and architects who flourished under Napoleon.

Caldwell & Co. was America’s premier producer of lighting and other metal objects during the turn of the 20th century through the 1940s. Notable clients of Caldwell lighting fixtures included the Rockefellers, Carnegies, and Roosevelts, and the company was also commissioned for famous landmarks such as the Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. The White House also has many Caldwell lighting decorations throughout. Caldwell & Co. manufactured unique and intricate lighting fixtures in their Manhattan factory, such as chandeliers, electrified lamps, and wall sconces.",0

Since the Middle Ages, the city of Limoges in central France thrived on the artistic production of enamel on metal. Similar in composition to glass, enamel consists of silica and a fluxing agent colored by metallic oxide or carbonate and fused to a metal surface by heat. From the twelfth through the fifteenth century, Limoges enamel painters gouged into the surface of the metal (champlevé) or raised thin dams between areas of color (cloisonné) to establish the design and to prevent pigments from mixing. By the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries, materials and techniques developed that permitted painters to apply enamels more freely to copper surfaces, without obvious demarcations between areas of color, in a manner that approached the painting of oil on paint or canvas. Unlike oil painting, enameled metal retains its hue without fading, or tel que l’ambre une fleur (like a flower in amber), as the poet Théophile Gautier wrote in a sonnet to the nineteenth-century enamel painter Claudius Popelin.

This technical development paralleled the growing cult of antiquity in France and the widespread circulation of printed images. While religious themes had dominated Limoges enamels in the Middle Ages and continued to cover the surfaces of Limoges plaques particularly in the first third of the sixteenth century, images of Greek and Roman subjects, readily available to painters through engravings and woodcuts, predominated from the 1530s.

Provenance: Jeremy, Ltd., London
England, circa 1770
Carton-pierre, literal translation from the French - cardboard stone, was developed in the 18th century specifically to imitate wood and stone. The Formula typically included flour, chalk, sawdust, sand and plaster and bound with wax, resin, animal glues or gum arabic. The material could be moulded, bent and otherwise formed into the desired design. Preeminent makers like Gillows and John Linnell began using carton pierre in the late 1760s. The new material allowed for lacey decorative spandrels and festoons that could be made into nearly any length or shape required. These elements and the particular foliate umbrella canopy on this pair of mirrors relates to designs of William and John Linnell. The most famous example of this crest element is on the mirror supplied by Linnell to the 4th Duke of Beaufort for the State Bedroom at Badminton House, sold from the Doris Duke Collection, Christie's New York, 3-5 June 2004, lot 442.
Linnell studied Rococo design, particularly by French exponents of the style, at St. Martin’s Lane Academy, founded by William Hogarth in 1735 (ed. G. Beard & C. Gilbert, Dictionary of English Furniture Makers 1660-1840, Leeds, 1986, p. 543). From an early age, he was inspired by the ‘antique’ taste promoted by the fashionable architect Robert Adam (1728-1792), with whom John Linnell and his father William worked on early commissions, including for the 6th Earl of Coventry at Croome Court, Worcestershire and Coventry House, Piccadilly from 1751-1763, and for Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Scarsdale at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire and London from 1759 (ibid., p. 547; H.

The ‘bleu’ pair were offered to the Queen of Holland on January 1868 (Vbb. 12, folio 50); the ‘turquoise’ were sold to M. Grace on 27 November 1867. The registry also retains a black and white photographic record of one of the pairs, which corresponds directly to the decoration on the present example, the registry card dated 1860.

E´mile Van Marcke de Lummen (French, 1827-1891) is recorded as a painter on porcelain at the Manufacture de Se`vres from 1853-1870. He was also a noted Barbizon painter who studied with Constant Troyon. He exhibited at the Paris salons from 1857 on, receiving medal in 1867, 1869, 1870 and was invested with the Legion of Honor in 1872. His work is in the collections of numerous museums in France as well as The Metropolitan Museum in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 

Van Marcke was born in Se`vres, Hauts-de-Seine, to a family of porcelain painters: his Belgian grandfather, Charles Van Marcke (1773-1830) and father, Jean-Baptiste Jules Van Marcke (1797-1848), painted at Se`vres from 1825 to 1832. It was there that Jean-Baptiste met his wife and E´mile’s mother, Julie Palmyra Robert, herself an artist and daughter of the director of the painting workshops at the Se`vres factory.",0

Measures: 11 1/4in (28.5cm) high (tallest one).
The earliest records of the silver atelier known as Yangqinghe date to 1775 in Shanghai. By the end of the Qing dynasty, it had the reputation as being the best silver workshop on the Shanghai Bund. Not only did they make decorative items, but also accessories and jewelry, popular among the Shanghai elite. After 1850, the atelier divided into three separate branches, Jiuji, Faji and Fuji, and passed to the ownership of Shao Youlian's family. 

Shao was a statesman who had served as the Qing court's charge d'affaires at St. Petersburg, had been a past governor of Taiwan and acting governor of Hunan. After his death in 1901, his family did not immediately divide up his estate, but his second son Shao Heng, gradually assumed ownership of the Jiuji branch of Yangqinghe. Shao Heng was known as a spendthrift and tended to neglect the business. Jiuji eventually ceased operation in 1935.

The bases of the some of the figures in the present lot are marked with the seal of the atelier's decorative art division, gongyibu, and also bear the mark of the individual maker, Hu Qiusheng.

Figures of the eight immortal are popular decorative motifs because it is believed that they can bestow blessings. They represent the spectrum of the human condition - young and old, rich and poor, civil and military, learned and uncultivated, male and female.

Burchardt Precht (d.1738), together with his sons Christian (d.1779) and Gustav (d.1773) were responsible for producing fine quality gilt-lead and gilt wood mirrors in Sweden during the 18th century. Although relatively little is known about Gustav, it has be noted that his father Burchardt, a sculptor and cabinet-maker originally from Bremen came to Stockholm in 1674 to work at Drottingham Palace. His son Christian was apprenticed to a goldsmith in 1721 before traveling extensively throughout Europe and returning to Stockholm in 1731. Later he became one of Sweden's leading Rococo silversmiths.

A rare and enchanting Meissen porcelain figure titled ""Till Eulenspiegel,"" crafted by the skilled hands of Willi Münch-Khe in 1928. This exquisite figurine portrays the legendary character Till Eulenspiegel in a moment of joviality, seated on a pristine white porcelain tree stump adorned with delicate hand-painted green details.

Till Eulenspiegel, the beloved German folk figure, is resplendent in a harlequin/jester attire that captivates with its vibrant colors. Diamonds in shades of white, lavender, and mint green adorn his costume, complemented by well-worn lavender boots and a magenta three-sleeve hat-cape secured with a delicate blue bow at the neck. Bells dangle from the ends of the sleeves, with the central sleeve at the back cascading down to the waist, creating a visual symphony of whimsy.

Perched on the stump, one foot raised, the other firmly grounded, Till Eulenspiegel exudes mirth with a devilish infectious grin and rosy cheeks. In his hand, he holds a naturalistic rattle of seed-pods on a branch, and he wears a delightful cross-over bag fashioned to resemble an owl that echoes the presence of a charming highly detailed hand-painted owl companion by his side.

The porcelain figurine stands 30 cm tall and bears the distinguished underglaze blue cross sword mark, along with incised and impressed numbers. The meticulous attention to detail captures the essence of Till Eulenspiegel's legacy, as he sits alongside his pet owl, embodying the spirit of German folklore. The scene is a nod to the carving found on Till Eulenspiegel's tombstone in Mölln, Germany, offering viewers a glimpse into the rich tapestry of medieval times and the enduring tales that have woven around this mischievous trickster.
