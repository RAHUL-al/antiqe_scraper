August Querfurt (1696-1761) is most well-known as a painter of soldiers and battle scenes. He was born in Wolfenbuttel, Vienna in 1696. His father, Tobias, a landscape and animal painter and the Brunswick Court Painter, was young August’s first teacher.

He studied under Rugendas and spent most of his professional career in Augsburg, Vienna. His paintings were thought to be modeled on the works of Wouvermans.

In 1752, Querfurt became a member of the Academy of Vienna. Querfurt painted a series of 12 paintings for Duke Karl Alexander of Württemberg. Two of those paintings, The Battle of Belgrade and The Battle of Blenheim were 11 meters by 4 meters. Querfurt painted 8 pieces for Empress Maria Theresa (1717-1780) of events from the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748). The works for the Empress are now housed in the Museum of Military History located in Vienna.

Querfurt lived during a very turbulent time. The Holy Roman Empire, The Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, Great Britain and a number of other forces fought several battles in and around Vienna while Querfurt was living there. In some ways it was perhaps destined for the artist to primarily paint military landscapes of battles and portraits of soldiers as for much of his life, his country was at war.

Querfurt died in Vienna in 1761."

H. Ritchie is entitled Lady Washington's Reception and is based on Daniel F. Huntington's original painting ""The Republican Court in the Time of Washington, or Lady Washington's Reception Day."" 

A.H. Ritchie, the engraver, was one of the best historical printmakers of the mid-19th century. He is particularly known for the clarity and richness of his engravings, and this fine image is an excellent example of his work. 

This print is filled with symbolism representing the regal status conferred on Martha and George in the mid-19th century. The elegance of the surroundings, the richness of the dress of those at the reception, and the formality of the situation and poses all recall a scene from any of the royal courts of Europe in the late eighteenth century. Indeed, it was likely the depicted refinement of the costumes and the obvious high status accorded to these American socialites that most explains the popularity of Huntington's oil painting and this elaborate print. 

On May 7, 1789, President George and Martha Washington attended a ball in their honor. The event provided a model for the first official inaugural ball, held to celebrate James Madison’s ascension to the office ten years later, which then became an annual tradition.

Washington was sworn in as the first president of the United States on April 30, 1789. A week later, an elaborate ball was held to celebrate the event in New York, the temporary headquarters of the federal government, in a building on Broadway near Wall Street. Unfortunately for the president, his wife Martha was unable to attend. She was still at their estate Mt. Vernon, in Virginia, where she was wrapping up business affairs before making the trip to New York.

Washington arrived at the ball in the company of other American statesmen and their wives. That evening he danced with many of New York’s society ladies. Vice President John Adams, members of Congress and visiting French and Spanish dignitaries, as well their wives and daughters, joined in the festivities. Eliza Hamilton, wife of Alexander Hamilton, recorded her impressions of the ball in her memoirs, noting that the president liked to dance the minuet, a dance she thought was suited to his dignity and gravity.",0

History of Design

There were originally 12 paintings depicting the story of Psyche based on Jean de La Fontaine's novel The Love of Cupid and Psyche (1669), which was itself inspired by the story of the Golden Donkey by the second-century Roman author Apuleius. This is one of the panoramic decorations. The original design was executed in a grisaille effect and 1,245 hand-printed wooden blocks were used to create the entire composition. It was originally produced by the famous French wallpaper company Joseph Dufour et Cie and then recreated in the second half of the 19th century by Desfosse & Karth.

Cupid, the god of love, fell in love with the mortal princess Psyche after accidentally pricking herself with one of his arrows. Cupid asked Zephyrus, the west wind, to bring Psyche to his domain. Upon arriving at Cupid's house, a voice tells Psyche to let the servants bathe her. Psyche agrees to the invisible master's command, which is the aspect of the story that our masterpiece illustrates.

If you look closely, you can see Cupid hiding his cleaver in the leftmost panel, watching intently.

Fraureuth was founded in 1866, and for almost a century produced some of Germany's finest porcelains, including some in the modern, bold style espoused by the German and Vienna Secessionist movements. Margold was born in Austria, studied in Königsberg and Mainz, and later became an assistant to Josef Hoffmann and an employee of the Wiener Werkstätte. In 1907, publisher Alexander Koch in Darmstadt became aware of Margold and published his designs in various magazines. Within a few years, Margold moved to Darmstadt to join the art colony there, and became a prolific designer of jewelry, porcelain, glass, fabrics and wallpaper.

Around the mid-sixteenth century French furnishing evolves in its conception and ornamentation. The start of major architectural projects – such as Fontainebleau castle – gives a new drive to artists. New formulas, smart and creative, are developed and then broadcasted through engravings. In addition, Italian artists working on French sites introduce local artists to the antic taste. 

The lower body stands on a moulded plinth. The two symmetrical door-leaves are adorned with carved panels depicting knights dressed à l’antique. They carry banners inflated by the wind. On the background can be seen walls and domes of a Medieval city amidst vegetation. An inscription identifies the man as Tiberius. Flower and fruit garlands hanging from a conch enrich the lateral and central posts.

The belt opens with two drawers framed by three acanthus leaves modillions. On each drawer is delicately carved sea horses emerging from the sea centred by a cringing mask. Its wide opened mouth acts as the drawer’s handle.

The upper body is isolated from the lower body thanks to an overlapping tablet. The door-leaves panels use again the knights’ motif. Riding prancing horses the two knights now hold spears. They are accompanied by two armed soldiers seated on bushes. On the background is figured a man standing on the serrated wall and waving at them. A boat sails away on the calm ocean. The lateral and central posts are not ornated. 

A frieze tops the upper body. Two sea horses with long and twisted bodies frame a winged putto head. Two other putti heads flank the frieze. 

The cabinet is completed by an sea-horses inhabited pediment disrupted by a central aedicula. The columned aedicula is flanked by foliated serpentine chimaeras. The central figure could represent Neptune. He is depicted with an imposing mane while his nudity is hidden by the floating draperies.

The lateral sides are enriched by rose and quill motifs.


This richly and originally adorned cabinet presents a strong structure and illustrates perfectly the late 16th century production influenced by Italy, Fontainebleau and antiquity. 

This cabinet also expresses the patron’s taste for antic history, a major source of inspiration from the late 16th century onward. Through Greek authors such as Herodotus or Roman ones such as Livy are glorified models of heroism and polical grandeur. The Flemish Maerten de Vos and other printmakers drew inspiration from these texts and produced engravings later used by cabinet-makers to adorn their productions. 

During the late 16th century Ninus (founder of Assyrian empire), Cyrus (founder of Persian empire), Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar are the most represented. Those four men evoke the biblical theme of the Four Empires highlighting the frailty of human conquests.

While our cabinet-maker did not represent the Four Empires he undoubtedly draw inspiration from the same sources. Thus he has depicted on the lower body door-leaves the Roman emperor Tiberius, famous for his military skills and his numerous victories. 

The cabinet-maker’s very precise and talented chisel has delivered to us an extraordinary cabinet where equestrian figures, marine animals and ornamental motifs mingle together in an elegant manner.

Subject: Scene from a life of Moses Series, probably the reconciliation of Miriam and Zipporah 
Period: Late 16th  / early 17th  century. 
Origin: Brussels
No makers mark 

Structure: 
Warp, wool, tan natural, Z-4-s, 19~20/in. 
Weft: wool Z-2, 60-64/in and Silk, Z-2 or z-3, 68-74/in 

Iconography: The likely cast of characters is follows: 

1.	Moses with halo in center, slightly to rear, presiding over the foreground event, the â€œhornsâ€ of the Old Testament text refer actually to rays of light. The goat-like protuberances of later art are really a literal and incorrect reading of the text. 

2.	The pair of figures on the left hefting an urn-like Ark of the Covenants one of which with a particularly fine back view and striped loincloth, are very Mannerist in style, indicating an origin in Italy, outside the Netherlands, in the circle of some early 16th century artist, possibly Giulio Romano, Mark Antonio Raimondi, Rosso Fiorentino or someone else of that trend. The figures are imported as a unit into the composition. Interestingly the two figures and their burden reappear in the 17th century French tapestry of the Triumph of Alexander after Charles Le Brun, but they have been swung around to nearly parallel the picture plane, although the rear orientation of the figure is still prominent. 

3.	The two female figure in the foreground may well be A.	On the left Zipporah, the wife of Moses; and B.	On the right Miriam, the sister of Moses. 

4.	A servant woman holds the train of Zipporah 

5.	Other Israelite women. Miriam and Zipporah are reconciled after a long period during which Miriam criticizes and speaks out against Moses and his policies as tribal leader. For this she is punished by God: her skin instead of being the brownish hue of the Israelites becomes white. Only when she ceases her dissent is she healed. This event may be depicted here. (cf Ex.. 4:14-16, Micoh 6:11, Deut. 24:9 for details).

The life of Moses was depicted in various other sets from 1530's on ward with among others the following subjects: 

1.	Passage of The Red Sea 
2.	Brazen Serpent 
3.	Finding Gathering of Manna 
4.	Moses Receiving The Tables of The Law 
5.	Rebecca and Eleazar 
6. 	Moses Prohibited from Setting Foot in The Promise Land 
7.	Worship of The Golden Calf 
8.	Joshua Defeats Amalek at the Battle of Rephidim 

Among the extant sets we may list: 

1.	The earliest a series of 9 panels (of 10), Brussels, 1530-40, designed by Bernard Van Orley and woven by Jan Gheetels, at Chateau Chateaudunt Somzee Coll. 
2.	Another set from the same cartoon also woven in Brussels, lacking a makers mark, 1545-1554, 9 panels (of 10) at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. 
3.	Five panels (of 10), c. 1575 woven by Martin Reymbouts in Brussels now at the Chartres Musee De Beaux Arts, given in 1578 to the cathedral by Bishop Nicolas de Thou 
4.	Two panels (of 10) in the San Francisco Palace of The Legion of Honor; Brussels, c. 1550, possibly by Peter II van Aelst (unknown artist, but the same as that for the panel from the life of Jacob in the same museum, some of the same figures are even used) 
5.	7 panels (of 10) from Oudenarde, 2nd half of the 16th century, now Monuments Historiques de France, much more traditional in style and lacking the Italianate mannerist elements. The whole effect is more planar and flat. 
The border could have come from a Verdure. The Life of Moses was popular later, and a set of indeterminate size, was woven in 1660â€™s in Brussels by Jan Parmentier with one panel, in square format, surviving. 

Apparently there are other panels surviving from The Life of Moses, but whether they constitute disjecta membra of true a series relating just Moses or whether they are single mosaic episodes along with other O.T. scenes in different cycles is open to question. They could belong with such non-mosaic scenes as Adam and Eve, Noah’s Ark, David and Goliath, Susanna and The Elders, David and Bathsheba, the Judgment of Solomon, etc. to illustrate various salient O.T. events. The border is slightly broken into at the top and bottom centre. The same effect, though more prominent, appears on a 12 Months of The Year series by Jan Franz van den Hecke, Brussels, c. 1590. It is possible that our piece may have some connection with his workshop.

The clock consists of polychrome hand-painted porcelain and gilt ormolu decoration. Characterized by their extravagant use of Rococo design motifs, mantel clocks such as this one were used not for their practicality, but as a display of immoderation and opulence.

Atop the vessel is a spray of gilt spring flowers: daffodils, foxgloves, roses, and morning bells. The ormolu fixtures on the clock face, stem, and apex complement the painted flowers on the surface of the porcelain.   Above the hands on the clock face reads “Maniere” in reference to the clock’s designer, Charles-Guillaume Manière. As the son of a Parisian master clockmaker, Manière became a master himself in the late 18th century and trained under other notable French designers. His work was often made in collaboration with Pierre-Philippe Thomire and François Rémond who possibly made the ormolu casing for his clock.  This is a very rare and highly prized piece for any collection. Similar clocks can be found in museum's around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NY and other museums around the world.

This grand tour Italian mixed marble and scagliola obelisk mixes Egyptian architecture into traditional European homeware. Made during the late 1700s, the object is a nod to the obelisks originally erected in Ancient Egypt. While Westerners have been influenced by Ancient Egyptian motifs for centuries, there was a distinct stylistic revival in the late 1700's and early 1800's due to European expansion and colonization of Northern Africa. Decorative elements from Ancient Egyptian architecture began to surface in European design, particularly in interior spaces. A symbol of rebirth, this obelisk is both representative of the revitalizing energy of the sun and the revival of the enduring Egyptian style.

Printed in blue ink on coarse, white linen, this patriotic kerchief shows a standing portrait of George Washington, above which is a swag valance and the words “The Effect of Principle, Behold the Man”. The portrait is based on a mezzotint after Gilbert Stuart’s very famous painting of Washington in his later years, most often referred to as the Landsdowne portrait. Stuart painted three versions of it in oil on canvas, one of which was completed in 1796 for a wealthy merchant by the name of William Constable, who commissioned the work for Alexander Hamilton.

The kerchief is interesting because it is both American-made and documented. This is exceptionally unusual for any printed textile of the 19th century or prior and the earlier the time period the more unlikely an object is to be identified. This kerchief and a companion piece entitled “The Love of Truth Mark the Boy” (also glorifying Washington, through the fabled story of the cherry tree), were made circa 1806 by Germantown Print Works in Germantown, Pennsylvania.

To the left of Washington's image is a portion of his infamous farewell address to his troops at the end of the Revolutionary War. To the right is a short excerpt from his eulogy. Below these are three images. In the center is a square-rigged tall ship with “Commercial Union” above it, flanked by the American eagle on the left and the British lion on the right. It is reasonable to assume that the textile may have been produced in demonstration of the maker's desire, and/or that of others, to advance trade with England. Commercial printers were very influential in early America, as they possessed the means by which to disseminate information.

This kerchief and its companion piece are documented in Threads of History, Americana Recorded on Cloth, 1775 - the Present, by Herbert Ridgeway Collins (1979, Smithsonian Press), p. 63, items 38 & 39.* The two pieces pictured are in the collection of Cornell University, but the Collins text also cites an uncut pair to be present in the collection of the Western Reserve Historical Society, Cleveland, OH. The name ""Germantown Print Works"" is printed on the Western Reserve examples. Another example of the textile in question is documented in ""Running for President, The Candidates and Their Images, 1789-1896"" by Schlesinger, Israel, and Frendt, (1994, Simon & Schuster), p. 15.

I have seen three different color variations of this textile, including sepia, mulberry red, and blue. This particular example has a hand-sewn binding along the top, lower, and left edges.

Mounting: The textile was mounted and framed within our own conservation department, which is led by expert staff. We take great care in the mounting and preservation of flags and have framed thousands of examples.

The gilded molding has a rippled profile and dates to the period between 1825 and 1850.The background is 100% cotton twill, black in color. The glazing is U.V. protective plexiglass. Feel free to contact us for more details.

Condition: There is an all-over golden oxidation of the white fabric and there is very minor staining. There are tiny tack holes in each corner and there are minor nicks around the perimeter.

* Collins relates that Germantown Printworks was operated by the Hewsons. In doing so he cites one of Worthington Chauncey Ford's books on George Washington, but it isn't clear which one (there are many) and no page numbers are given. John Hewson was an Englishman who came to America and opened his printing business on the advice of Benjamin Franklin. He was one of the first “calico printers” and is the earliest documented to have advertised printed kerchiefs. His ads for bandanas appear as early as June 20th, 1774. He is suspected of having produced the very first American kerchief that pictured an American president, which is documented in Collins as item 1 on page 48. Linda Eaton, curator at Winterthur, in 2012, is currently doing in depth research on the three printers of fabrics that were operating in Germantown in early America. She discovered that the owner and/or operator of Germantown Print Works, while not currently known, was not John Hewson. This information is not yet published. She also noted that Winterthur possessed examples of the two George Washington textiles.

The map depicts the region from Susquehanna, Maryland to the northern Outer Banks in North Carolina. It also shows from Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia to the Atlantic Ocean. The map is highly detailed with many cities and towns labeled throughout. Rivers, inlets, and bays are also labeled. Various charts illustrating more specific parts of the region are marked on the map using dotted lines. The lines form boxes, and the corresponding chart number and publication date are given. Extensive triangulation surveys were conducted the length of Chesapeake Bay and are illustrated here. Hampton Roads, Virginia is labeled, along with the James, York, and Rappahannock Rivers, which were all extensively surveyed.

The chart was published under the supervision of A. D. Bache, one of the most influential and prolific figures in the early history of the U.S. Coast Survey, for the 1856 Report of the Superintendent of the U.S. Coast Survey. Alexander Dallas Bache (1806-1867) was an American physicist, scientist, and surveyor. Bache served as the Superintendent of the U.S. Coast Survey from 1843 to 1865. Born in Philadelphia, Bache toured Europe and composed an important treatise on European Education. He also served as president of Philadelphia's Central High School and was a professor of natural history and chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. Upon the death of Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler, Bache was appointed Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey.

The Office of the Coast Survey, founded in 1807 by President Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of Commerce Albert Gallatin, is the oldest scientific organization in the U.S. Federal Government. Jefferson created the ""Survey of the Coast,"" as it was then called, in response to a need for accurate navigational charts of the new nation's coasts and harbors. Today, the Coast Survey is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA as the National Geodetic Survey.

A status symbol between the 17th and 19th centuries, most garniture sets have by now been damaged or broken up with the individual pieces sold off. Few complete sets now exist, and even fewer survive in their original state, which makes this beautifully painted set of three Chinese Porcelain Famille Rose vases so much more special. With mandarin orange and gilt unusually bold and swooping dragon handles, each delicately decorated vase is completed with a lid seating a gloriously pompous foo dog. The bodies are decorated with hand painted famille rose flowerpot cartouches, as well as, chirping birds, and banded flowers and vines.

The exquisite hand painted tastefully colored floral displays each with their own hand painted vase creates a freshness and inspires within us the IDEA for further additions of fresh flowers within the home. One of the porcelain, three (3) piece garniture set, is smaller and has a variation of banded colors around its fluted foot, lending just the right amount of visual variation to this gorgeous trio. The white porcelain bulbous bodies are further decorated with colorful insects, gilded scrolls and flowers between bands of bead and flower swags to neck and high foot, with 24k gold & mandarin orange petal borders to mouths and foot and fully modeled gilt Dragon handles from sides to shoulders.

This English Porcelain Trompe L'oeil Covered Cauliflower Form Box is a unique and fascinating example of the trompe l'oeil (meaning ""trick of the eye"") style of decorative art. This particular box is crafted from porcelain, a delicate and refined Material that was highly prized in 18th century England. The box takes the form of a cauliflower, with the base of the vegetable serving as the body of the box and the intricate and lifelike leaves forming the lid. The lid fits snugly onto the base, creating a functional and secure container that can be used to store small treasures or other items.
England, circa: late 1700s

The trompe l'oeil technique used to create this box is what makes it truly special. The level of detail and realism is astounding, with every vein and crease of the cauliflower leaves carefully replicated in porcelain. The overall effect is so convincing that it is easy to forget that the box is not a real cauliflower. This box would have been a highly prized possession in the 18th century, not only for its functional use but also for its artistic merit. It is a testament to the skill and creativity of the porcelain artisans of the time and a charming reminder of the whimsical and playful spirit of the era. Today, it remains a valuable and highly sought-after example of the trompe l'oeil style and a unique addition to any collection of decorative arts.",0

He brought back the Peacock Throne from his victory in India after defeating the Ottoman Turks.

Provenance.

Old master painting in oil on canvas by the artist Giacomo Guardi (1764-1835). This is a particularly Fine work by Francesco Guardi’s son, Giacomo Guardi. Like his father, Giacomo is also a master of the Venetian Genre paintings which picture the beautiful ancient city and it’s colorful people. It is likely that this painting was executed while Francesco was still alive. It expresses a similar style and technique. It shows excellent draftsmanship and artistic quality of the foreground figures on the quay to the smallest of details. This painting could well be the work of a collaboration with Francesco. After the passing of his father, Giacomo concentrated mostly on small format paintings in gouache or drawings. His oil paintings from the early period are extremely rare. Giacomo Guardi committed himself to the great tradition of Venetian Baroque art. His works exhibit great atmospheric charm and are of great historical value. Guardi’s works are preserved by prominent museums around the globe. This painting belonged to the estate of the renowned collector, philanthropist Henry Alexander Count of Salm-Hoogstraeten, Tuxedo Park, New York. A label on the back of the painting states the attribution to Giacomo Guardi.

The head is made from hand carved white Carrara marble, the tunic and toga are made from hand carved honey alabaster, which are all supported on a cipollino marble socle. The bust rests on a robust column of red Breccia Pernice marble, mounted on a Carrara marble base and top.

The detail to this bust is truly exceptional. The quality of a marble bust is noted from a few factors; the first being the hair of the bust. Hair is an extremely delicate and free-flowing body part, which makes it very difficult to hand-carve with a realistic feel. The next factor in marble bust quality is demonstrated in the face. Humans have distinct characteristics that sets them apart from one another. An exceptional bust allows someone to just glance upon it and recognize the person immediately. The final factor in marble bust quality is the clothes. Like hair, fabrics are free-flowing in nature, with variable curves and inconsistencies. A true master marble sculptor will exceptionally carve the general attire of the bust, in this case a tunic and toga, to resemble that of a free-flowing garment in the breeze, with curves and silhouettes. This bust of the Roman Emperor Titus Domitian reflects all these key characteristics and more. The hair is elegantly hand carved with exceptional detail, seemingly life-like in appearance. The facial features are perfectly in line with what Emperor Titus Domitian's is regarded to look like, a strong Romanesco nose, lightly wrinkled forehead, frowning eyebrows, a mid-sized mouth, and well-carved ears with a slight left head tilt. Finally, the garments on this bust, which include the tunic and toga, are exceptionally well hand carved, demonstrating natural free-flowing linen silhouettes, curves and billows. The culmination of these key-characteristics define this marble bust as truly exceptional.

Titus Flavius Caesar Domitianus Augustus was Roman emperor from 81 to 96 AD. He was the younger brother of Titus and the son of Vespasian, his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the Flavian dynasty. Domitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. His 15-year reign was the longest since that of Tiberius. As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage, expanded the border defenses of the Empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome.",0

Paolo Veronese (Born 1528, Verona, Republic of Venice - died April 9, 1588, Venice) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance in Venice, famous for paintings such as The Wedding at Cana and The Feast in the House of Levi. He adopted the name Paolo Cagliari or Paolo Caliari and became known as ""Veronese"" from his birthplace in Verona.

Veronese, Titian and Tintoretto constitute the triumvirate of pre-eminent Venetian painters of the late Renaissance (16th century). Veronese is known as a supreme colorist, and for his illusionistic decorations in both fresco and oil. His most famous works are elaborate narrative cycles, executed in a dramatic and colorful Mannerist style, full of majestic architectural settings and glittering pageantry. His large paintings of biblical feasts executed for the refectories of monasteries in Venice and Verona are especially notable. His brief testimony with the Inquisition is often quoted for its insight into contemporary painting technique.

Veronese's secular and allegorical history painting falls into two groups: His public commissions for the Ducal Palace and the Library of St. Mark's and his decoration of villas and palaces belonging to the Venetian nobility. His greatest accomplishment of the first type is the Triumph of Venice (1583) in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio of the Ducal Palace, which shows in its center Venice a female allegorical figure, resplendent in opulent beauty and ease, crowned by Victory and raised by clouds, slowly ascending to the heavens. In the second group are the Rape of Europa circa 1580, which follows the account of Ovid in his at once playful and yet awed praise of the power of Cupid, and Darius and the Family of Alexander circa 1565-1567.

History:
Reliquaries (also referred to as a shrine or châsse in French), are containers used to protect and display relics. A portable reliquary may be called a fereter, and a chapel in which it is housed a feretory. A monstrance, also known as an ostensorium (or an ostensory), is a vessel used in Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, High Church Lutheran and Anglican churches for the display on an altar of some object of piety, such as the consecrated Eucharistic host during Eucharistic adoration or Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. It is also used as reliquary for the public display of relics of some saints.

The use of reliquaries became an important part of Christian practices from at least the 4th century, initially in the Eastern Churches, which adopted the practice of moving and dividing the bodies of saints much earlier than the West, probably in part because the new capital of Constantinople, unlike Rome, lacked buried saints. Relics are venerated in the Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic and some Anglican Churches. Reliquaries provide a means of protecting and displaying relics. While frequently taking the form of caskets, they range in size from simple pendants or rings to very elaborate ossuaries.

The relics were enshrined in containers crafted of or covered with gold, silver, gems, and enamel. These objects constituted a important form of artistic production across Europe and Byzantium throughout the Middle Ages.

Many were designed with portability in mind, often being exhibited in public or carried in procession on the saint's feast day or on other holy days. Pilgrimages often centered on the veneration of relics. The faithful often venerate relics by bowing before the reliquary or kissing it; those churches which observe the veneration of relics distinguish between the honor given to the saints and the worship that is due to God alone. 

Sixteenth-century reformers such as Martin Luther opposed the use of relics since many had no proof of historical authenticity and objected to a cult of saints. Many reliquaries, particularly in northern Europe, were destroyed by Calvinists or Calvinist sympathizers during the Reformation, being melted down or pulled apart to recover precious metals and gems. Nonetheless, the use and manufacture of reliquaries continue to this day, especially in Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian countries. Post-Reformation reliquaries have tended to take the form of glass-sided caskets to display relics such as the bodies of saints.Relics of the True Cross became very popular from the 9th century onward and were housed in magnificent gold and silver cross-shaped reliquaries decorated with enamels and precious stones. From about the end of the 10th century, reliquaries in the shape of the relics they housed also became popular; hence, for instance, the skull of Pope Alexander I was housed in a head-shaped reliquary. 

Relics play a major role in the consecration of a church. The consecrating bishop will place the relics on a diskos (paten) in a church near the church that is to be consecrated, they will then be taken in a cross procession to the new church, carried three times around the new structure and then placed in the Holy Table (altar) as part of the consecration service.

Many tales of miracles and other marvels have been attributed to relics beginning in the early centuries of the church."

A. Ogden was published in 1908 by Brigadier General J. B. Allshire. Originally published as a comprehensive series of U. S. military uniforms, this print showcases five different uniforms from the years 1902-1907 with six figures total. This specific print is designed to show the uniforms of non-commissioned officers and staff corps. From left to right, the dress is of the 1st Sergeant Coast Artillery, Musician Infantry, Regimental Sergeant Major Infantry, Private Signal Corps, Corporal Engineers, and Private Signal Corps. These positions are written with identifying figures in the bottom margin along with the stated publishing information.

Non-commissioned officers are enlisted military officers that have obtained their position through promotion rather than commission. Many officers receive commissions directly out of a military academy and immediately become officers based on education. On the contrary, on-commissioned officers began as enlisted military personnel.

The artist, Henry Alexander Ogden, was an American Illustrator with a passion for early American history. That passion led Ogden to embark on the largest project of his career. He set out to record and illustrate all of the U.S. military uniforms from 1890-1907. Not long after Ogden began, the Quartermaster General of the Army approached him and requested he expand his project to include all uniforms since the founding of the nation. Ogden agreed and eventually published all of his popular illustrations in multiple sections. Each print always featured five different ranks, and therefore five different uniforms. This print is no exception.

Condition:
Overall very good condition. The lithograph’s colors are vibrant and there is no evidence of discoloration. No creases are visible and the print has no loss or tears. Neatly framed, the print is housed according to archival standards including non-acidic mats and UV protective glass.",0

Printed cotton kerchief, made for the 1912 presidential campaign of Theodore Roosevelt when he ran on the Progressive Party ticket (a.k.a., the Bull Moose campaign). This graphic textile, in a classic, western style, typical of the iconic red bandanna, is indicative of both the Republican Party in the late 19th century, and T.R.’s love of the American West.

In this example, a geometric design with diamonds, surrounded by multiple, linear borders, is accompanied by the following text along the top and bottom that reads: “The Roosevelt Bandanna” and “Progressive Party,” respectively. A maker’s mark in the lower right corner reads “Cochranes Mfg. Co.” Cochrane’s was known for their long-lasting, red dye process, called “Cochrane’s Turkey Red.”. It was really a process, as opposed to a dye itself, to which the name applied. The dye was actually a derived from a synthetic colorant called “alizarin,” imported by Alexander Cochrane’s family, who emigrated to the United States from 1847, and owned a chemical company in Massachusetts that produced the dye. The fabrics were produced by the family of John Cochrane, who emigrated from Renfrewshire, Scotland in 1844. Both families, who resided in Malden, Massachusetts initially, traced their ancestry to Barrhead, Scotland, in the heart of the textile-producing region, near Glasgow and Paisley. It was in Glascow that Turkey Red printed bandannas are said to have originated, in the shop of Henry Monteith & Company, in 1802.*

TR's decision to enter the 1912 election was not exactly popular among many of his friends and former supporters. His participation manifested into a unique political incident, in which the independent, Roosevelt, beat out a major party ticket, garnering 27.4% of the vote. At the same time, however, he lost the White House, not only for himself, but for his former Republican friends as well, by dividing support between his own candidacy and that of incumbent President William Howard Taft. The result handed the office to Woodrow Wilson, who became only the second Democrat politician to be elected to our nation's highest office since 1856 [noting that Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms, 1885-89 and 93-96).

A bandanna in this style is documented in “Threads of History”, by Herbert Ridgeway Collins, (Smithsonian Press, 1978), as item 937 on page 372. Collins served as curator of Political History at the Smithsonian and his landmark text is considered the “Bible” of political flag and textile collecting.

* My thanks to quilt expert Barbara Brackman’s for her research on the Cochrane families and the Turkey Red dye process.

It is of interest to note that the Turkey Red process, which became a significant industry in India, seems to have been taken there by Keshav Malhar Bhat, the first Indian to attend of MIT, who met with John Cochrane, in 1882 – the same year during which he studied in Cambridge -- and garnered enough knowledge to return to India and initiate manufacturing. This was a rather significant event in the textile industry, and Indian-American history alike, as American textile manufacturers were notoriously secretive about their processes, and no more Indian students were admitted to MIT for 20 years hence.

Mounting: The flag was mounted and framed within our own conservation department, which is led by expert trained staff. We take great care in the mounting and preservation of flags and have framed thousands of examples.

The background is 100% cotton, black in color, that has been washed and treated for colorfastness. The mount was then placed in a dark brown, concave molding with a grain like mahogany, to which a black-painted and hand-gilded, Italian molding was added as a cap. The glazing is U.V. protective acrylic (Plexiglas).

Bernard Brantham Carslake was born in Caulfield, Melbourne on July 14th 1886. A big-framed Australian, ‘Brownie’ Carslake – so nicknamed because of his sallow complexion (brought about by years of “existing on a cup of tea and hope” as he put it) – first came to England in 1906. He was never officially apprenticed but was taught to ride by his father, a well-known Caulfield trainer. 

His weight was his obsession: he constantly fought the always-increasing weight his muscular body was meant to carry.

His first winner was Lady Watkins at a Bush meeting in his native land. Carslake, a stylish dresser, had impeccable manners and an ability to mix easily with any level of society.

He married Annie Langley on November 13th at the Church of St John the Evangelist, Leeds. He was in Austria when The Great War began and fled to Romania disguised as a railway fireman. He then fled to Russia where, in 1916, he was champion jockey. The next year’s Russian Revolution made him a fugitive again and he fled back to England. He brought with him a large sum of money in roubles, only to find the currency worthless. 

Ever resilient, he quickly picked up his racing career. Three times he won the St Leger, twice the 1,000 Guineas and twice the Ascot Gold Cup. He was also successful in the 2,000 Guineas and the Oaks. 

He was a demon cricketer and in the 1922 Jockey Boxing Championship defeated J.Evans in a Charity Tournament which raised over £5,000 for Sussex County Hospital. Then, gradually, a lifetime of fasting began to take its toll. Carslake refused to recognize the decline in his abilities until 1928 when he became a trainer – but 12 months later he was back in the saddle. It was a bad move.

In 1940, having just won by a short head on Ipswich, he collapsed in the weighing room at Alexandra Park. The next year - on Tuesday evening, July 29, 1941 aged 55 - having retired to his home in Whitsbury, Salisbury, the jockey with the hooked nose and protruding chin passed away. He left £1,417. 14s. 5d.

He became the first Australian jockey to adopt the short leather Tod Sloan style of riding. A poisoned leg prevented Carslake from riding in April 1928.

Carslake had no liking for switchback courses, preferring the wide open spaces of Newmarket and Doncaster. His record at Epsom, Alexander Park, Brighton and, to a lesser extent, Goodwood, was poor.

His wife Annie was granted a decree nisi in an undefended action for divorce. She gave evidence that her husband admitted infidelity in 1930 and they had separated in 1931. She revealed that she had her husband watched in the last year and that he was living with another woman in Bradford.

In May 1930, Carslake was fined £10 for dangerous driving and ignoring police signals. The police gave evidence that they were compelled to chase the jockey a long distance by motor car.

In April 1927, riding Birthright at Newmarket, the colt bolted. By the time Carslake had pulled it up, it had covered 10 miles. Bernard Carslake’s classic wins: Two Thousand Guineas: Tetratema (1920) One Thousand Guineas: Ferry (1918) and Silver Urn (1922) The Oaks (Light Brocade (1934) St Leger: Keysoe (1919), Salmon Trout (1924) and Scottish Union (1938)

Celina Decorações
Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo

CELINA ZYLBERBERG's design, together with Sérgio Rodrigues' Oca, were responsible for the innovation of modern furniture in the 1960s, a genuinely Brazilian concept.

Celina was a founding partner of the Boa Vista tapestry, one of the most famous textile industries in Rio de Janeiro for decades.

In the early 1960s, her son Muniz Zylberberg, with an eye on the growing modern furniture market, transformed the fabric factory into a chain of wooden furniture stores, specializing in Rosewood, and renamed it Celina Móveis e Decorações.

Focused on austere administration to allow the expansion of the number of stores, the production of Celina's modern furniture was cheaper than that of Tenreiro and Sérgio Rodrigues but with comparable quality of execution and finishing.

Celina Decorações had stores in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and in addition to producing pieces in series, they also made a series of customizations to their furniture to suit the interior projects that they offered to customers.

In the 1970s it provided a line of office furniture. With the implementation of many hotel chains and apart hotels, the group specialized in institutional interiors: Othon, Caesar Park.

The shade of dark and light blue create a striking contrast and is a stunning example of blue and white Chinese ceramics universally appealing due to the color combination, mirroring the natural blue and white of the sky and with an ability to brighten even the darkest corner of a room.

Baccarat is a French luxury crystal company that manufactures and sells high-end products. Founded in 1764 by artisans in Lorraine with the permission of King Louis XV, Baccarat is known for its craftsmanship, quality, and innovation. The company's products include lighting, tableware, decorative objects, fine jewelry, and custom flacons, and are designed to symbolize French artifacts.

The fleur-de-lis is a stylized lily or iris with three petals that's often used as a decoration or heraldic charge. The term comes from the French words fleur (""flower"") and lis (""lily""). The fleur-de-lis has a long history and has been used in many different ways, including:
Royal coat of arms
French kings used the fleur-de-lis as a symbol of their sovereignty, and it was featured on the traditional French coat of arms from the High Middle Ages until the French Revolution in 1792. English kings also used the symbol on their coats of arms to emphasize their claims to the French throne.",0

The Colonne de Juillet is a monument in France in recognition of the Revolution of 1830. It stands in the middle of the Place de la Bastille, and recognizes the ""three glorious"" or Trois Glorieuses (July 27-29) which was the fall of Charles X the King of France and the commencement of King Louis-Philippe, ""King of the French"". It was built between the years 1835 and 1840. This piece is truly spectacular and embodies the true masterpiece of the original Colonne de Juillet. The columnar body rests on a round carrara marble socle, which holds-up the dore bronze column. The dore bronze column sits on a square marble base which steps up-to a carrara marble base with dore bronze medallions symbolizing the great country of France. The upper portion is ornamented with Barye lions masks in high-relief with four putti found on either side of the upper column. The corinthian style column was designed by Jean-Antoine Alavoine. The middle of the column is all hand-chassed and hand-chiseled with the names of all the people that passed away during the 1830 war. The base is fitted with Eagles with garlands extending from each of their talons. The base is very ornate with a tremendous amount of detail, with square plaques each with writing symbolizing the war, dates and other France inspired quotes. This piece was latter fitted with electrical components to be used as a lamp.

The body is constructed of silver over bronze and each section is incredibly cast, hand-chased, and hand-chiseled with the finest detail. Flanked on either side of the centerpiece are two marvelous silvered bronze handles each designed with low relief diamond patterns. The top rim is beautifully designed with notched banding and pointed Islamic Arabesque motifs which cascade off the side. The piece is supported by four curved feet which are finely decorated.

Edouard Lièvre (1829-1886) was one of the greatest designers of the late 19th century. He was mostly known for his orientalist and Japonism styles. He designed many pieces, which were executed by F. Barbedienne and Christofle, and many retailed by A L'Escalier de Cristal, located near the Opera, 6 rue Scribe in Paris. These exceptional vases are very similar to the persian vase, executed by Lièvre, and exhibited at the Paris Expositions Universelles in the year 1878."

This porcelain plaque is decorated with a re-creation of Gabriel Metsu’s 1661 oil painting titled “Lovers at Breakfast.” The porcelain forms a flat surface much like the oak panel of the original painting. It is Mounted in a sumptuous and intricate gold-painted frame. 

Metsu’s painting is a depiction of him and his wife Isabella de Wolff enjoying breakfast in a Tavern. Dressed finely, the couple huddle together in nearby chairs to feast on dried fish, a small bread roll, and a handful of berries. A silver teapot sits on the table next to the remaining food.  Stiff, but obliging, the young woman offers a few berries to her husband who is jubilantly toasting with a glass flute. It looks as though he is attempting to excite his wife about the journey ahead, a notion she is resistant to acquiesce to.  Gabriel Metsu’s original paintings have auction sales records in the millions of dollars from Christie's and Sotheby's Auction.

Meissen plaques are incredibly rare and this subject is probably one of the rarest ever produced. The plaque is hand-painted by the best artists in the Meissen Porcelain Manufacturer in the ""Golden Age"" of Meissen creation. This plaque is an inspiration of the incredible quality, variable levels of light and dark, and loving attention to Saskia, Rembrandt's wife. The plaque depicts Rembrandt and Saskia drinking together in a Tavern. Both figures in the plaque are one-in-one with Rembrandt's vision on variable light and dark themes, as well as highly detailed and complimentary brush strokes. The back of Rembrandt's hat and body is slightly darker than the opposite side where Saskia is seated; this depicts his thoughtful process of mapping out light and dark trends in his works of art. The quality, technical ability, and perfect color balance of this plaque are superb and most probably one of the greatest plaques ever to be produced by Meissen. Meissen is the foremost creator of Porcelain Plaques and this particular subject is on top of them all. The back of the plaque consists of Underglaze blue crossed swords mark.

Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was born in Leiden in the Netherlands in 1606. In around 1631, Rembrandt lodged in the house of an art dealer called Hendrick van Uylenburgh, and while there, he met his landlord's young cousin Saskia and got married in 1634. Rembrandt is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of art, possessing an exceptional ability to render people in their various moods and dramatic guises.

'Rembrandt und Saskia im Gleichnis vom verlorenen Sohn' is housed in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister of Dresden, Germany and was painted in 1637 as an oil on canvas. Rembrandt is also known as a painter of light and shade and as an artist who favored an uncompromising realism that would lead some critics to claim that he preferred ugliness to beauty. Rembrandt is renowned for his outstanding ability to render the human figure and its emotions. Another aspect of Rembrandt’s genius is the acute and loving attention with which he observed the world around him. In his renderings of women and children and of animals and landscapes, he showed a strong understanding of the significant detail, but he noted these impressions with extraordinary freedom and economy.

This fantastic Meissen porcelain plaque depicts the biblical story of Abraham telling Hagar to leave. Abraham is seen with a white beard and wearing a light blue garment with a red robe as he tells Sarah, his wife, to push away Hagar and her son Ishmael somewhere else. Underneath Abrahams red robe is a young Isaac. Ishmael is seen taunting Isaac, his half brother, which leads to Sarah becoming angry and forcing Hagar to leave. This illustrious plaque was original painted by Old Master artist Adrien Van Der Werff (Dutch, 1659-1722), and is based on the story from the book of Genesis. Van der Werff's well-known mastery of illustrating clothes and drapery is only highlighted in this exquisite piece of art shown through the details in Abraham's clothing along with Ishmael's tattered robe. Meissen plaques are exceptionally rare and this subject is even more special as a master Meissen artist was commissioned to create this masterpiece. The back is marked with underglaze blue-crossed swords mark and the subject of the plaque is also written underneath.

The sculpture features many floral motifs and decorations. Robes worn by the two figures are patterned with delicate flowers—small blossoms have also fallen onto the ground where the man sits. The bright, saturated enamel makes for a delightfully engaging scene and alluring composition.  This particular version shows more vibrant enamel and happier expressions, making it a fine example of the mastery of Meissen porcelain.  Chinoiserie style decoration is very unusual and highly prized for Meissen collectors.  The dragon and parrot are extremely ornate and very rare to find in this type of Meissen porcelain subject.  The porcelain group rests on a rococo style ormolu base with an elaborate amount of detail and fine chase work. 

Porcelain sculptures such as this one often depicted joyous couples enamored with one another. Lighthearted, youthful, and amorous, these couples bring vivid life to the homes they decorate—despite being frozen in time and space.

Charles Le Hon, a Belgian politician, lawyer and industrialist, served as Ambassador to France and deputy to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives. He was created Count in 1836 and a Minister of State in 1856. Fanny Mosselman, a Belgian noblewoman, married Le Hon in 1827 and they had three children Eugène (1828-1860), Louis Xavier Léopold (1832-1879) and Louise (1838-1931). They occupied her father's hotel particuliere in the Chaussée d'Antin, Paris from 1831 and the Hôtel Le Hon, rond-point de Champs-Elysée from 1843. Fanny was very socially prominent, her glittering Paris salon attended by famous politicians and members of the Royal Family. Her lovers included the duc d'Orléans and most famously the duc de Morny, illegitimate son of Queen Hortense and therefore half-brother of Emperor Napoleon III. Honoré de Balzac described her as ""Iris in light blue, the golden haired Ambassadress"".
This splendid coffre-fort or strong box conceived in the neo renaissance style of the late 1830s is decorated with the arms of Le Hon and Mosselman below a Count's coronet as well as decorated with acanthus arabesque. As Le Hon was created a Count in 1836 its manufacture must post date this. It is also likely to have been manufactured in Paris where the Le Hon lived.
Interestingly in 1851 their son Eugène married his cousin on his mother's side, Charlotte Mosselman (1837-1912). Their son René was born in 1858. It is therefore also possible that this box was commissioned by Eugene's parents as a wedding gift in 1851. As his wife was also a Mosselman, the arms would have been equally appropriate for them as for their parents.",":

It is a relief portrait of Karl XIV Johan as a Roman general, with text ""Carolus XIV Iohannes Rex Sveciae et Norvegiae"" and made by Finspång's foundry. It has a small metal loop attached on the back so that it can hang on a wall.

Finspång's foundry was for about three centuries Sweden's largest cannon foundry, located in Östergötland's northern mountain range, Finspång is mentioned for the first time as a foundry in 1573.  A small foundry was built there at the time, which was first run on behalf of the crown, but in 1587 was leased to the Dutchman Wellam De Wijk, who seems to have held it until 1599, when it was passed back to the crown. 
in 1641 Louis De Geer (1587-1652) bought the entire Finspång estate, which had by then grown to a large manufacture of canons and war material including land with mines. De Geer made Finspång the center of the Swedish arms industry. It was held by his descendants De Geer af Finspång until 1856, when the estate was sold to its manager, Carl Ekman. The company ceased its production in 1911. 
King Charles XIV John (Swedish: Karl XIV Johan (1763 – 1844) was King of Sweden and Norway from 1818 until his death in 1844 and the first monarch of the Bernadotte dynasty. In Norway, he is known as Charles III John (Norwegian: Karl III Johan) and before he became royalty in Sweden, his name was Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte. During the Napoleonic Wars, he participated in several battles as a Marshal of France.
Born in Pau in southern France, Bernadotte joined the French Royal Army in 1780. Following the outbreak of the French Revolution, he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks, and was made a brigadier general by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with Napoleon was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a Marshal of the Empire on the proclamation of the French Empire. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at Austerlitz, and was made Prince of Pontecorvo as a reward. Bernadotte was, through marriage to Désirée Clary, brother-in-law to Joseph Bonaparte, and thus a member of the extended Imperial family.

In 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the heir-presumptive (Crown Prince) to the childless King Charles XIII of Sweden. He assumed the name Charles John (Swedish: Karl Johan) and was named regent, and generalissimo of the Swedish Armed Forces, soon after his arrival becoming de facto head of state for most of his time as Crown Prince. In 1812, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of Swedish Pomerania, Crown Prince Charles John was instrumental in the creation of the Sixth Coalition by allying with Alexander I of Russia and using Swedish diplomacy to bring warring Russia and Britain together in alliance against France and Denmark. 
After the War of the Sixth Coalition, Charles John forced King Frederick VI of Denmark to cede Norway to Sweden, leading to the Swedish–Norwegian War of 1814 where Norway was defeated in 19 days. This put Norway into a union with Sweden, which lasted for almost a century before its peaceful 1905 dissolution. The Swedish–Norwegian war is viewed as Sweden's last direct conflict and war.
Upon the death of Charles XIII in 1818, Charles John ascended to the thrones. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.",0

Félix Chopin (1813-1892) was a French bronze designer, the son of the Parisian fondeur Julien Chopin. He moved to St. Petersburg in 1838. Around 1841 he acquired the workshop of Alexander Guérin were he mainly designed and manufactured lighting fixtures, including chandeliers, candelabras, table lamps and torcheres. Chopin designed a chandelier for The Vladimir Hall, in the Grand Kremlin Palace, in Moscow and also designed a chandelier of the Tsarevich's in the Peterhof Palace in 1850, another chandelier for the Marble Palace in St. Petersburg (1849) and the palace of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich (1855-86) (ibid p. 168). He favored the 'French Rococo' style which gave him the freedom to experiment with exuberant and whimsical designs for Russian designers and marketplace, as well as for the Russian nobility.

Chopin designed several art pieces with Eugene Lanceray. For example, they designed a sculpture of a horse, which is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

This incredible sculpture is by Jean-Léon Gérôme (French, 1824-1904), one of the most famous and inspirational Academic French artists of the 1800s, who started to cast and make object art, like sculptures, in the later years of his career.

This amazing sculpture is called 'Bacchante à L'Amour' or 'Bacchante à la Grappe'. The piece is made out of ormolu or doré bronze and demonstrates bacchante, who is a woman follower of Bacchus. Bacchus is the Greek G-D of parties and wine, otherwise known in Roman mythology as Dionysus. Bacchante is seen with her head against a thyrsos, a special staff created of a fennel plant. At the top is an acorn finial with vines around it. The thyrsos and Bacchus are symbolic of fertility, wealth, and a life-time of pleasures. At the mid section of the thyrsos is a beautiful ormolu putti climbing up while the Bacchante holds fruit, most probably grapes, above him.

The figure is mounted on a round base with Jean-Léon Gérôme's signiture, 'JL. Gérôme' as well as the number C575. The Parisian Foundry mark can also be found on the base from Siot-Decauville, Paris, the location where this figure was cast. The figure was made in 1892 in three size variations.
Paris, circa 1892

49.5"" x 43"" x 12"" 

An important religious folk art work, the Nandi is of carved wood and gessoed cloth, then hand-painted. In Hindu religion, Nandi is the mythical mount of Shiva. The four legs represent truth, righteousness, peace and love. 

More than a means of conveyance, Nandi is considered Shiva's constant companion on all his travels, so much so that in any temple dedicated to Shiva, there is a sculpture of Nandi. This symbol is a deity in its own right, and in India there are temples dedicated exclusively to Nandi. 

In Hindu symbolism, the bull represents both strength and ignorance. The white or light color of the bull symbolizes purity and justice. Symbolically, the seated Nandi towards sanctum in Shiva temples, represents an individual jiva (soul) and the message that the jiva should always be focused on the Parameshwara. From the yogic perspective, Nandi is the mind dedicated to Shiva, the absolute. In other words, to understand and absorb light, the experience, and the wisdom is Nandi, which is the guru within. The fact that Shiva uses it as a mount symbolizes how this divine figure removes ignorance while instilling strength and wisdom.

A superb example, the life size work is in great overall shape, and presents wonderfully, having beautifully aged patina over the whole, highly desirable original, worn, rustic, naturally distressed, chippy paint, craquelure finish, that's delicate, and enhances the artistic antique character and rich historic depth.

From The Dallas Morning Newspaper; April 12th, 2021

Neiman Marcus is selling some of its history and valuables that have been displayed and stored for decades as part of the luxury retailer’s corporate art collection. 

The Neiman Marcus corporate art collection dates back to 1951, when Stanley Marcus (1905-2002), a life long avid art collector, purchased Mariposa, a large mobile by Alexander Calder and started a long tradition of buying original artwork for new stores as they opened. The Mariposa sold at a Sotheby’s auction last month fetching $18.2 million. The items are being offered through Sotheby's auction house, NYC, New York and Heritage Auction, Dallas, Texas.

Many of the pieces were personally collected by Stanley Marcus from the 1960s through the 1980s.

Some of the pieces are from corporate spaces, stores and the company’s archives, among the items are important antique textiles, tribal robes and embroidery, all handmade items from China, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa and the Oceana region of the Pacific.

The luxury retailer permanently closed several stores and vacated two large office spaces in downtown Dallas last year as part of its bankruptcy. Neiman Marcus, which operates 37 Neiman Marcus stores, Bergdorf Goodman in New York and five Last Call stores, has been shoring up its balance sheet. 

“We have notable pieces that we want to transfer to other collectors so they can be preserved with care,” Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Amber Seikaly said. “These are things that deserve to be in peoples’ homes.”

For many years, the Neiman Marcus Collection had a dedicated curator and included a couple of thousand pieces."

Pierre-Georges Jeanniot
Switzerland, 1848-1934

The artistic education of Pierre Georges Jeanniot began with his father, Pierre-alexander Jeanniot (1826–1892), a longtime director of l’École des Beaux-arts of Dijon, France. Nevertheless, Pierre-Georges Jeanniot started out pursuing a military career, as an infantry officer (1866–1881), but he never ceased drawing. He was known for the first time in 1872 at the art exhibition salon de Paris, where he presented a watercolor painting called 'intérieur de forêt'.
The next year he presented the painting 'Le Vernan à nass- sous-Sainte-anne'. From then on he was a regular contributor to the salon de Paris, where he presented new works with views of Toulouse, Paris, Troyes, the edges of the seine, and some portraits. In 1881, after the army offered him the rank of commandant, he resigned to devote himself exclusively to painting. He took up residence in Paris. His works from this period represent mainly scenes of military life that allowed him to forge a reputation. Jeanniot established himself permanently in 1882 and obtained his first award the following year (medal third class of the Salon de Paris).
From then on, he started to show a certain artistic independence. He then mostly portrayed Parisian women during the “Belle Époque”, women in bathing suits on the beaches (a new phenomenon in those times) or scenes on the race course. These paintings give us a vivid sociological portrayal of his times. But as soon as the Société nationale des Beaux-arts was founded in 1899, he rallied to their new painting trend. In Paris, he secured himself friendships and memories of Édouard Manet, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Jean-Louis Carnival, Paul Helleu, and especially with Edgar Degas, whom he revered as a master. He spent much time with edgar Degas in his family home in Diénay (Côte-d’or). He was gifted with many talents and also excelled with his drawings. He showed in his drawings his passion and his artistic strength. They are vivacious, expressive and enthusiastic, while at the same time, rendering with a sense of humour the picturesque scenes of daily life. During the next decades he illustrated a large number of literary books. He was one of the first collaborators (together with Théodore de Banville, Alphonse Daudet and Giuseppe De nittis) of the review La Vie Moderne and also contributed to the review La Lutte Moderne. In a later stage he became the director of Journal amusant, while also offering contributions to Rire and L’Écho de Paris. As an engraver, he also sketches ironic scenes from the daily life depicting in lively traits the snobs of Paris. His talents suggest a resemblance to the works of Toulouse-Lautrec and Mary Cassatt. At the same time he also used the woodcut printing technique allowing vivid contrasts between dark and bright parts of the image. His works can be found in many museums, though most are situated in France (Calais, Nancy, Paris, Carnavalet, Pau, toul and toulouse), but some in other countries (Oslo, New York, Buenos Aires).

The porcelain plaque is incredible with the most dynamic amounts detail hand-enameled and hand-crafted.  The subject depicts an old man seated in the foreground of the image. His face is lit in concentration as he sharpens his quill. Students in the background are quietly focused on their work, aglow from afar in the soft window light. Dressed in academic regalia and bearing thin wire specs, the old man exudes the idea of intellectual prowess during Renaissance period Europe.  KPM porcelain plaques with old master painting subjects are highly sought after and very collectible.  They are some of the most collectable and prized KPM plaques in the market.  This piece is extra rare as it is in its original giltwood frame.

Dutch Golden Age painter Gerrit Dou was born in 1613. He is known best for his genre paintings, depicting ordinary people minding their quotidian lives in the comfort of interior spaces. A student of Rembrandt, his warm, candlelit night scenes of daily life evoke the powerful stoicism of Dutch painting and the democratizing force of narrative artwork.

While Russia endured great hardships during Napoleon's invasion, it was the skill of her general's and a terrible Russian winter, that lead Russian to her final victory and the destruction of Napoleon's grand army. This elegantly glazed figural group shows a moment of action as a Officer hands a message to the General who is proudly astride his prancing white horse. The Artist's skill is apparent in the details of the flowing cloth and the unusually beautiful musculature of the Horse's body. The figures stand on a Neoclassic base decorated with victory wreaths.

The group is in the Turkish/Islamic taste with a Malabar man in beautiful middle eastern colorful attire seated on a gorgeously life-like rhinoceros. The Malabar man is commanding his rhino to lead him to his palace as he is nobleman with extensive arrays of jewelry, silk robes, and a gold tasseled cushion to sit on. Meissen pieces in this condition and quality are exceptionally rare and this subject is even rarer. To add to the rich and exquisite nature of this piece, it even has 24K gold hand-painted throughout the cushion and on the Malabar man.

In the final years of his life, Goblet exhibited repeatedly at the Royal Academy, as he had done since 1799. The present bust was possibly exhibited in 1821 (no. 1161), the first female bust he presented since showing a portrait of his daughter in 1811. 

A smaller bust also carved in 1820 by Goblet, of the famous Italian soprano Angelica Catalani, is in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London (NPG 5039).

Lewis Alexander Goblet was a London-based sculptor who had a close relationship to the celebrated sculptor Joseph Nollekens, as his primary assistant in the studio and eventual inheritor of the atelier. Together they completed several major commissions for clients such as King George III and William Pitt the Younger. Goblet accepted private commissions in his own right while working for Nollekens, and exhibited consistently at the Royal Academy for most of his career.",0

This is an extraordinary quality object de virtue and is made with one of the rarest and most beautiful stones, bloodstone jasper. The hand-carved, beveled bloodstone insets are mounted on the finest quality of dore bronze. The oval shaped dore bronze mount consists of two snake form handles on either end of the tray. The dore bronze is striking when see in person; perfectly hand-chiseled, hand-chassed, and finished with a matte appearance, dore bronze with this quality is either from the early 19th century (1800's) or 18th century (1700's). The inside of the tray is lined with red gemstones, each mounted on dore bronze mounts. The oval body rests on four fine quality dore bronze scrolling legs, which are all finely finished.

Bloodstone, also known as Heiotrope, is a type of dark green extremely rare stone which usually includes well-defined small red spots. As bloodstone is a very delicate and difficult stone to find in the highly red spotted variety, this suggests that only a formidable stone sculptor of the Imperial Russian Empire was decreed to craft these masterpieces.",0

Donaghho, Parkersburg, W. Va.

“Potter and businessman Alexander Polk Donaghho was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania, July 2, 1829, and he died in Parkersburg in 1899. It is thought that he learned his trade in the Monongahela Valley in Pennsylvania, at a pottery owned by an uncle. He came to Parkersburg in 1870 and began a pottery operation there in 1874. Donaghho crocks and other items of pottery are avidly collected today.

Probably working with a few employees, Donaghho made pottery by hand, ‘‘throwing’’ it on a potter’s wheel just as it had been for hundreds of years. The majority of his ware had a generally cylindrical shape with slightly bulging sides. Virtually all of the crocks or wide-mouth pots featured a bold top molding and two ear handles on the shoulder below the rim. Jugs had a small top opening for a plug and a one-ring handle. Pottery canning jars usually had no handles but had a deep groove in the rim for the wax seal.

The ware was dried in a steam-heated room, after which it was stenciled with cobalt oxide. The pots were marked ‘‘A. P. Donaghho,’’ or ‘‘Excelsior Pottery’’ on big pieces, and ‘‘Parkersburg.’’ Many were decorated with advertisements for retail establishments. When thoroughly dry, the ware was placed in a bottle kiln to be fired.

Donaghho pottery was salt-glazed, with damp salt reacting in the hot kiln to produce a sodium aluminum silicate glaze.”",":

Kellogg. 

William Henry Brown and his wife, Emmaline, left Philadelphia around 1859 and settled in a small railraod community of Saxton near Altoona, PA. He had gone there to work on the railroad, since photography had put him out of work. By 1865 he had moved to Erie, PA and was married to Margaret Horrell. They had two sons. She died shortly thereafter and he moved to Wilcox near Kane, PA. Later he lived with a niece in Georgia then married a third time to Sarah Conrad. After her death he returned to South Carolina. Connecticut Historical Society still has the 6 foot silhouette of the """"Dewitt Clinton"""" locomotive he had done in 1831. They also have 14 prints he gave them in 1853 of silhouettes that are not part of the Portrait Gallery. A traveling artist, William Brown was a portrait painter and silhouettist, whose subjects were distinguished persons, especially in Philadelphia, New England, and Charleston. Brown was especially noted for a series titled """"Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans"""", published in 1846 as a book of lithographs from his full-length silhouettes. Also included were biographies of the subjects.

He was born in Charleston but spent more time in Philadelphia than in the South. He trained as an engineer but in the early 1830s, devoted himself increasingly to art.
He first worked in New England and then went South, spending much time in Charleston in the 1840s and early 1850. In 1842, he was in Natchez, and he was also in St. Louis and New Orleans. However, by the late 1850s demand for his work had lessened, and he returned to being an engineer, first in Philadelphia and then in Charleston where he died in 1883.

John Forsyth Sr. (October 22, 1780 – October 21, 1841) was a 19th-century American politician from Georgia. He represented the state in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and also served as the 33rd Governor of Georgia. As a supporter of the policies of President Andrew Jackson, Forsyth was appointed secretary of state by Jackson in 1834, and continued in that role until 1841 during the presidency of Martin Van Buren.

Alexander Macomb (April 3, 1782 – June 25, 1841) was the Commanding General of the United States Army from May 29, 1828, until his death on June 25, 1841. Macomb was the field commander at the Battle of Plattsburgh during the War of 1812 and, after the stunning victory, was lauded with praise and styled """"The Hero of Plattsburgh"""" by some of the American press. He was promoted to Major General for his conduct, receiving both the Thanks of Congress and a Congressional Gold Medal.""

Showcasing an esoteric design and artful craftsmanship, this vintage overdyed rug has been given a twist. The controversial pistol pattern and atmospheric colorway woven into this piece work together creating a truly one-of-a-kind look. A faded backdrop sets the scene cultivating a thought-provoking focal point with a multifaceted impact open to the viewer's interpretation of the 2nd amendment. Regardless if hung on the wall in a gun club or placed on the floor in a shooting range, this gun rug has the ability to add immense visual interest to a space where there isn’t any. Whether or not this style speaks to you depends on your response to uninhibited, raw, and abstract forms of art.

Iconic in its styling and austere elegance, this overdyed rug is befitting for gun aficionados, NRA, and hunting enthusiasts in mind. Perfect for a gunroom, man cave, arms cache, trophy room, armory, gun club, great room, studio, study, loft, living room, drawing room, billiards room, clubhouse, large home office, or lounge area. The piece was made through a thorough process consisting of: distressing, overdyeing, and hand shaving the pistol pattern into the rug.

At first glance, the box's visual allure is simply breathtaking. Adorned with meticulous hand-carved and hand-painted details, this remarkable objet d'art boasts an enchanting theater scene that graces all four sides. The choice of platinum paint upon the dark black lacquered background adds an ethereal touch, casting a mesmerizing sheen and elevating the overall aesthetic. The theater scene unfolds upon a checkerboard stage, where a solitary figure takes center stage, surrounded by delicately crafted scrolls and flourishing foliate motifs.  Further, the box's elegant form is elevated by the addition of gilt foo-dog head feet, which lend a sense of regality and balance to the composition.  The box's architectural elements are nothing short of remarkable. An elevated pediment, adorned with resplendent gilt bells and delicate curls, gracefully ascends in multiple areas, culminating in a peak at the top finial. This architectural feat not only showcases the skill of the craftsman but also adds a sense of harmony and symmetry to the design.  One of the most striking features of this extraordinary antique is the juxtaposition between the dark black lacquered background and the platinum-painted stage scene. The contrasting tones create a captivating interplay, drawing attention to the scene's platinum allure while accentuating the cream-colored roof and steps with their attached gilded ornamentation. 

To complete its allure, the roof of the box serves a dual purpose: it acts as a lid, elegantly lifting on a hinge with a supporting bracket.  This exceptional 19th-century French gilt lacquered wood pagoda form chinoiserie silver painted decorated large box is a testament to the artistry and sophistication of its time. Its striking combination of a dark black lacquered background, platinum-painted theater scene, and gilded embellishments create a visual symphony that captivates the eye.

The intricate craftsmanship of this piece is a harmonious blend of white opaline glass, adorned with resplendent ormolu mounts. Its form mimics a delicate egg, expertly fashioned in two parts, featuring a splendid doré bronze opening.

Resting upon a naturalistic doré bronze base reminiscent of a bird's nest, this masterpiece stands gracefully on a foundation of twisted doré bronze branches that serve as legs. Enhancing its allure, a doré bronze trestle formed by two prominent straight doré branches is elegantly bound together by a doré bronze rope. An exquisite double ball pendant dangles from the apex where the straight branches converge.

The trestle exquisitely showcases doré winding leaves and flowers, meticulously arranged along a sinuous vine that wraps around them.

Barbedienne.  This captivating piece stands as a testament to the impeccable craftsmanship of its era. Elevated on resplendent acanthus scrolled feet, this enameled ormolu bowl evokes a sense of grace and elegance. The four sides feature meticulously crafted enamel panels, adorned with mildly stylized foliate in designs. Delicately hand-painted enamels of roses, morning glory, and intricate red and yellow blossoms grace these panels, captivating the beholder's eye. Taking an oval shape, the bowl boasts two larger sections on each of its elongated sides, accompanied by two smaller, more rounded sections on either end. The smaller panels exhibit a serene pale blue background, while the longer side panels present a striking dark blue backdrop, enhancing the visual allure of this masterpiece. 

Exceptional in quality, this Jardinière showcases the intricate art of Champlevé enameling. Similar to cloisonné, this technique involves the application of enamel to discrete cells separated by metal. However, in Champlevé, the metal base features cast or cut-away cells, leaving raised metal lines that form the outline of the design. These cells are then meticulously filled with molten or powdered glass, which is subsequently fired to achieve its vibrant allure. The bronze sculpture ormolu body of the Jardinière boasts a breathtaking level of ornateness. Elaborate scrolls in high relief adorn the entire rim of the vase, gracefully ascending in the center of the front, back, and sides. Further enhancing its allure, a smooth shield of meticulously crafted ormolu adorns both the front and back of the Jardinière, augmenting its visual appeal.  Hand chased and intricately carved, this highly ornate design showcases the skilled craftsmanship of the era, inviting admiration for its exceptional attention to detail and artistic finesse.",0

The composition of this coupe exhibits a visually pleasing structure, with two layers of grand gadrooned lobes gracefully encircling the base of the bowl. The baluster stem with a circular base is adorned with two striking doré bronze enameled bands, featuring hand painted enameled elaborate stylized flowers that infuse the coupe with vibrant and colorful accents. Additionally, a wide doré bronze banded mount encircles the bottom of the base, captivating the eye with meticulously hand-painted scrolls and captivating bright enamels, presented in a stylized fashion. 

A beautifully rounded midsection embellishes the stem, characterized by bulbous elongated egg fluting below and a gracefully curving neck at the top, culminating in a vividly hand-painted enameled band. The hand-carved body of the basin exhibits organic asymmetry, exemplifying the painstaking craftsmanship involved in its creation and resulting in a breathtaking natural form.

Adorned with a luxuriant mass of thick, pale wavy hair, elegantly styled in a low bun, she emanates an air of timeless beauty.

Her form is veiled by a pale yellow robe, adorned with darker yellow banding, gracefully draped around her midsection. With her left hand, she not only clasps one of her pretty red sandals, but also holds the drapery in place, while her right hand reaches down to secure the other sandal onto her freshly washed foot. She balances with her left foot upon a rock, and as a final touch of natural beauty, an enchanting ivy plant with lush green leaves gracefully ascends the sides, harmoniously complementing the captivating scene.  The entire tableau rests upon a splendid swooping step pedestal. This ornate base features meticulously crafted maritime motifs in intricate relief, lending an aura of nautical splendor. Encircling the pedestal is a gilt banding.

The foreground of the scene is adorned with detail that creates a sense of depth and perspective. The blue sky and puffy afternoon clouds surrounding the women add to the idyllic atmosphere of the painting. The vase's body is a beautiful deep shiny blue background with extensive delicate gilded decoration in a lace-like pattern surrounding the entire vase except for the painted scenes.

This Louis XVI style dore bronze lamp is the quintessential display of French empire decorative opulence. Its exaggerated urn shape is meticulously cast with ormolu detailing that covers the entire surface of the lamp. 

On either side of the vase are two decorative handles, made out to be fancifully embellished elephant’s heads. The inclusion of elephants—which were introduced to French culture through Imperialism and trade between Western Europe and Asia—are significant of the Orientalist ideology that emerged in the 19th century. French designers looked to “exotic” and unfamiliar imagery to incorporate into their traditional European motifs.  The lamp is signed by Ferdinand Barbedienne, a French metalworker and sculptor well-known for his bronze working skills. For much of his career, he focused on making miniature replicas of statues and eventually expanded to produce household furnishings. His hope was to democratize the exclusivity of French empire luxuries and widen accessibility to the working class.

The set has 217 pieces in total consisting of 36 dinner silver forks, 36 silver soup spoons, 36 dinner knives ( silver handles with steel blades), 24 silver tea spoons, 24 dessert vermeil silver spoons, 24 dessert vermeil silver knives, 6 silver vermeil open salts, six corresponding vermeil silver salt spoons, a silver pierced ladle, 2 large silver serving spoons, a pair of silver tongs, a silver fish slice, a mustard vermeil silver spoon and a sugar vermeil silver sifter. The silver was assayed by D.Tverskoy and weighs 570 Troy Ounces in total.  The majority of the pieces are dated and hallmarked with the name of the maker and the assayer. 

Practically all the pieces in set bear the crest and initials ( refer to photo gallery) of an aristocratic Russian family  whose identity was first thought  to have been the Sheremetevs  but  which has since been questioned through some gratuitous and generous correspondence with Mr Douglas Smith  an awarding-winning American historian and author of four books on Russian Imperial  History.  

The subject of one of Mr Smiths most acclaimed and widely read books published in 2012 titled ""The Former People : The Final Days of the Russian Aristocracy"" is of particular relevance to this flatware. This was the first book to recount the history of the aristocracy caught up in the maelstrom of the Bolshevik Revolution and the creation of Stalin's Russia.  It is filled with chilling tales of looted palaces burning estates, institutionalized terror inflicted with impunity on the aristocracy by marauding peasants and Red Army soldiers, of imprisonment, exile, and execution. Many aristocrats were killed in the process. Those lucky enough to escape were driven into exile taking with them whatever precious possessions they could.  Most ended up boarding rescue ships on the Black Sea in Crimea disembarking in  France notably the Cote D'Azur and Paris. To survive in their new homeland many had to sell some or all of the treasures that they managed to smuggle out of Russia. This flatware was very likely part of this unfortunate legacy.

The silver was acquired  privately in Vancouver after filtering down from the estate of the Woodwards family likely that of  ""Chunky"" Woodward, one of Western Canada’s last great renaissance men and owner of Woodward’s department store chain. Mr Woodward,  who passed away in 1990, was also a renowned philanthropist and a collector of fine arts. Where and when Mr Woodward acquired the silver is a mystery but a sales receipt dated 12 December 1921 that accompanied ( refer to photo Gallery)  the silver shows that it was originally retailed by  a shop called “A La Veille Russie” 18 Faubourg St. Honore in Paris.  

""A La Vieille Russie""  which is still in business today on Fifth Ave in New York City, was founded by Jacob Zolotnitsky in Kiev in 1851. By the end of the nineteenth century the business had built a strong reputation in Imperial Russian circles trading in antique jewelry, snuff boxes, silver, and Russian and European porcelain. 

Following the Russian Revolution and ensuing Bolshevik purge of the aristocracy, the business relocated from Kiev to Paris in 1920. where it quickly became an intellectual  and sales hub  for exiled Russian aristocracy and nobility.  Among them were Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, Queen Marie of Romania, Grand Duchesses Xenia and Olga (sisters of Tsar Nicholas II), the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and King Farouk  I of Egypt,

That this flatware ended up for sale at ""A la Vielle Russie"" in Paris in 1921 , a year after the shop opened for business, is therefore hardly surprising and follows the historical chronological order of the tumultuous times in Stalinist Russia. 

All the experts contacted in Russia by Mr Smith in his effort to trace the origins of the silver including art historians, noble genealogists, museum curators and others, all agree that the flatware is extraordinary but what could not be ascertained is who commissioned it.  Mr Douglas suggests that the Sheremetev family could have owned it but it was not made for them largely because when the silver was commissioned in the mid 19 Century there was only one  Sheremetev , namely Count Dmitry Nikolaevich.  As well, the coronet shown on  the crest is typically associated with non-titled Russian nobility.  Most of the Sheremetevs were titled and would have used a different more elaborate coronet that the one on the flatware. Mr Smith adds that it is more indicative of a bit lower down the noble rungs. 

The timing of the sale of the silver also  suggests that it was not the Sheremetevs who sold it to ""A la Veille Russsie"" in Paris as Count Alexander Dmitrievich Sheremetev and his wife fled to Finland in 1917 and didn't go to Paris till the late 1920s. A few other members of the family left via the Crimea in 1919 and moved to the south of France. It is conceivable that they  could have visited Paris when the shop opened for business in 1920 before they moved on to Rome, but according to the descendants of the family contacted by Mr Smith, they left with only a few suitcases and none of them have ever seen the monogram on the silver before.. Finally, the Sheremetevs in exile bought more Russian treasures  than they ever sold.  Having fled with very little they never realized they would not be going back.  While in the west, they tried to buy up art and antiques from Russia to replicate a bit of what they had lost. The only way to know  who the silver was commissioned by is through the records from the silver master Andrei Bragin. This could take enormous research and equally enormous luck as they have most likely not survived. 

Finally, one last intriguing  factor relating to the provenance of the silver is that  the 1921 sales receipt for the flatware lists a Monsieur Frick as the customer. Is it possible Monsieur Frick refers to Henry Clay Frick the American industrialist, financier and art patron  and founder of the Frick Museum in New York. The mystery does not end here as Mr Frick died two years earlier than the date on the invoice but he left an endowment of trustees who carried on his collecting legacy after his passing. 

 The head archivst at the Frick Museum IN New Yourk City Ms Julie Ludwig wsa contacted On August 2023  in regrads the reference to a Monsieur Frick in the 1921 invouce. Ms Ludwig was unable to establish a connection between  the  silver and the Frick family.  Ms Ludwig  reiterates that Henry Clay Frick died in 1919, which makes it impossible for him to have purchased the silver personally.   Also a review of a series of vouchers for bills paid by his estate in the early 1920s do not include A La Vieille Russie listed in the voucher index. 
 
 Ms Ludwig states that Frick’s widow, Adelaide H.C. Frick, and her daughter, Helen Clay Frick, both traveled to Europe in 1921, but they returned home in July, so she cold not place either of them in Paris in December.  Neither was there any any record that Frick’s son, Childs Frick, was in Europe that year.  

However the fact that the  Frick's  wife and daughter were in Paris earlier on the same year it was sold is encouraging  as one could perhaps speculate  that the silver was acquired by the Fricks but had a representative n Paris  paying for it and claiming it on their behalf a few months later. The receipt does suggest this 3 rd party involvement.

Most boxes from this period in Paris made by the Baccarat crystal producers were bearing a paper label and unfortunately after years of use and contact with water the paper label is lost or washed away in most cases.  The condition is very good consistent with use and age.  The bezel has some staining from age, and can be easily cleaned upon clients preference.

In its centre is the crest of a gilt rampant lion, within a belt inscribed SINCERE. Marked on the back with “Barr Flight & Barr, Royal Porcelain Works Worcester. London House Flight & Barr Coventry street, established 1751” with the royal crown and Prince of Wales feathers and the encircling words: “Manufacturer to Their Majesties Prince of Wales and Royal Family”.

Condition: Some light wear to the gilding and some light surface scratches. Small hairline crack to the handle which only shows on the reverse. Small stain mark to the foot rim. 

This dish comes from a service provided for Colonel Pauling Carruthers of Painswick, Gloucestershire, which has been several times sold through Sotheby‘s: on 4 July 1964 in London (lot 146), 11 April 1997 in New York (lot 317) and most recently a part dessert service (6 place settings) on 12 August 2020 in New York (Lot 293) which sold for $11,340. A variation of the pattern, bearing the crest and feathers of the Prince of Wales, made circa 1807, is illustrated in Henry Sandon, Flight and Barr Worcester Porcelain 1783-1840, p. 19. 

Condition: A small amount of wear to the gilding

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries Chinese porcelain decorated with the family Coat of Arms was a great status symbol. The porcelain took years to arrive and was sometimes full of mistakes. Worcester produced a magnificent alternative, becoming the height of fashion in the early 19th century. Customers included Tzar Alexander I, The Duke of York, King George III, King William IV, The Duke of Clarence, The Imam of Muscat, The Marquis of Buckingham and the Nabob of Oude. The Prince of Wales bought at least six services including two Imari dessert services in 1807 and awarded the company his Royal Warrant in the same year.",0

The tanuki seated, its right foreleg raised, its other foreleg beating its distended stomach, the well-patinated wood slightly worn, the eyes inlaid in horn with dark pupils; signed underneath MINKO with a kao.


Good, dark patina.


Size: 3.5 x 2.5 cm


Condition: In Very good condition commensurate with age.


The tanuki possesses magical powers and can change forms, sometimes into Buddhist monks; they are jovial, but also dangerous, as they have been known to suffocate hunters with their enormous scrotums. The act of drumming on the belly, according to legend, was used by tanuki to beguile travelers and hunters to lead them astray. However, it has also been said that tanuki would get together just for fun, drumming on their bellies under the moonlight, perhaps even with some sake involved.

Each obelisk is complete with four sides which terminate upwards to a triangular point.  The bases are fitted with ormolu mounts which include hand-chased and hand-chiseled maidens holding flaming torches in either hand and on the other panel decoration of a vine with a winged bow.  On top of the large ormolu mounts are smaller mounts which depict child masks in wings.  Underneath and on top of the square base are ormolu mounts which depict acanthus leaves flourishing throughout with hand-chased and hand-chiseled fluted veins.  The entire body of the obelisk is veneered with the most incredible and highest quality antique Russian malachite stone.
Russian malachite is a captivating mineral renowned for its deep, rich green color and striking banded patterns. Originating primarily from the Ural Mountains in Russia, this variety of malachite features swirling, concentric circles and unique formations that make each piece distinctively beautiful. Its vibrant hues and intricate designs have made it a sought-after material for fine jewelry, decorative carvings, and ornamental objects. Historically significant, Russian malachite has adorned palaces and churches, reflecting its cultural and artistic value.

The peacock is gorgeously hand-chased and hand-chiseled with fine details in a mixed-metal arrangement, which represents the multitude of colors that a peacock has in its feathers.  This mixed-metal design is gorgeous with shades of gold, silver, and bronze.

Another notable element of this piece is the hand-painted enamel on the tabletop. The surface shows a two-dimensional stack of three fans: one black, one red, and one white. They each feature a different design, decorated by Japonesque motifs. A synthesis of European and East Asian style, this table represents the Orientalist movement of the 19th century and cross-cultural pollination across the French empire.  The piece is further adorned with 24K gilt decoration.

C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik

C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik AG (also known as Bechstein) is a German manufacturer of pianos, established in 1853 by Carl Bechstein.

Before Bechstein

Young Carl Bechstein studied and worked in France and England as a piano craftsman, before he became an independent piano maker. His first pianos were made for other companies.

C. Bechstein

C. Bechstein piano factory was founded on 1 October 1853 by Carl Bechstein in Berlin, Germany.

Carl Bechstein set out to manufacture a piano able to withstand the great demands imposed on the instrument by the virtuosi of the time, such as Franz Liszt. In 1857, Hans von Bülow (Liszt's son-in-law) gave the first public performance on a Bechstein grand piano by performing Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor in Berlin

By 1870, with endorsements from Franz Liszt and Hans von Bülow, Bechstein pianos had become a staple in many concert halls and private mansions. By that time three piano makers, all of which were founded in 1853, became established as the industry leaders across the world: Bechstein, Blüthner and Steinway & Sons.

In 1881 Bechstein began supplying pianos to Queen Victoria. A gilded art-case piano was delivered to Buckingham Palace, followed by several more Bechstein pianos to Windsor Castle and other royal residences. By January 1886 they were among the piano manufacturers holding a Royal Warrant as a supplier to the Queen. Several British embassies across the world acquired Bechstein pianos.

In 1885, Bechstein opened a branch in London, that eventually grew to become the largest showroom and dealership in Europe. By 1890 showrooms had been opened in Paris, Vienna, and Saint Petersburg. On 31 May 1901, Bechstein Hall, built at a cost of £100,000, was opened next to the company's London showroom at 36-40 Wigmore Street. Between 1901 and 1914, C. Bechstein was the largest piano dealership in London. At that time, Bechstein was patronized by the tsars of Russia, the royal families of Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Austria and Denmark, and other royalty and aristocracy. The list of royal clients of Bechstein may be found on the soundboard of vintage Bechstein pianos made before the Second World War. The list is part of the original Bechstein trademark logo; it can be seen under the strings in the center of a piano's soundboard.

The signature of Carl Bechstein

The years from the 1870s through 1914 brought Bechstein their most dramatic increase in sales. In 1880 a second Bechstein factory was opened in Berlin, and the third factory was opened in 1897 in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Production reached 3,700 pianos annually in 1900, and 4,600 in 1910, making Bechstein the largest German manufacturer of high-end pianos. At that time, about three quarters of production went to international markets, especially Britain and the Commonwealth, and Russia.

Carl Bechstein died in 1900, and the Bechstein company continued to operate under the management of his sons.

Between 1900 and 1914 C. Bechstein was one of the leading piano makers in the world, employing 1,200 craftsmen and workers by 1913 and making five thousand pianos per year.

First World War

C. Bechstein suffered huge property losses in London, Paris, and St. Petersburg during World War I. The largest loss was in London. Although the company's position in the United Kingdom was initially unaffected, with the company still listed as holding a Royal Warrant in January 1915, Warrants to both King George V, and his wife Queen Mary were cancelled on 13 April 1915. Bechstein was not the only musical concern to be affected by growing anti-German sentiment: there were earlier attempts, led by William Boosey, to boycott German music altogether. In 1915, despite being a Baronet and Privy Counsellor, Sir Edgar Speyer, who was then funding the Proms, was forced to leave the country. Following the passing of the Trading with the Enemy Amendment Act 1916 the British arm of the company was wound-up on 5 June 1916, all Bechstein property, including the concert hall and showrooms full of pianos, were seized as ""enemy property"" and closed. In 1916 the hall was sold as alien property at auction to Debenhams for £56,500. It was renamed Wigmore Hall, and then re-opened under the new name in 1917. All 137 Bechstein pianos at the Bechstein showrooms were confiscated too, and became property of the new owner of the Hall. After a dispute with his brother, Edwin Bechstein left the company and was paid off.

Eventually the Bechstein factory resumed full-scale production during the 1920s. At that time, technical innovations and inventions of new materials and tools, as well as improvements in piano design and construction, had allowed Bechstein to become one of the leading piano makers again.

The most successful models were the updated ""A""-185 and ""B""-208 grand pianos. The upright pianos became more popular after the war, and C. Bechstein were successful with its upright pianos Model-8 and Model-9, both of which have been considered the finest upright pianos.

As the company was changed into a joint-stock company 1923, Edwin Bechstein and his wife Helene, bought themselves back into the company as shareholders.

In 1930 the company collaborated with German electrical goods manufacturer Siemens under Nobel laureate Walther Nernst to produce one of the first electric pianos, the ""Neo-Bechstein"" or ""Siemens-Bechstein"" electric grand, using electromagnetic pickups.

Edwin Bechstein and his wife, Helene Bechstein, who was an ardent admirer of the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, bestowed many gifts on Hitler including his first luxury car, a red Mercedes costing 26,000 marks. Helene Bechstein and her friend Elsa Bruckmann introduced Hitler to Germany’s cultural elite in Berlin and Munich. ""I wish he were my son,"" she said.

After Edwin Bechstein died in 1934 in Berchtesgaden, where he had a villa named ""Bechstein"" in a short distance to the Obersalzberg, his body was transferred to Berlin. He was buried following a state funeral attended by Adolf Hitler and NSDAP politicians, including Wilhelm Frick and Max Amann.
Second World War

In 1945, allied bombing raids destroyed the Bechstein piano factory in Berlin, along with the firm's stores of valuable wood, including the precious Alpine spruce used to make soundboards. The war also cost the company many of its experienced craftsmen. For several years after the war, Bechstein could not resume full-scale production of pianos and made only a few pianos per year.
After World War II

After de-Nazification of the C.Bechstein Company, they started in 1948 to produce pianos again. C. Bechstein eventually increased piano production to about a thousand pianos per year during the 1950s and 1960s. However, the new economic situation in the post-war world was hard for the piano business. In 1961 the Bechstein piano factory was affected by the construction of the Berlin Wall. The ownership of C. Bechstein had changed several times. In 1963 all the shares were sold to the Baldwin Piano Company. Up until the reunification of Germany, the company was making fewer pianos, although the quality of craftsmanship remained high.

In 1953, the centennial of Bechstein was celebrated by the Berlin Philharmonic under Wilhelm Furtwängler and Wilhelm Backhaus. Many entertainers and concert pianists, such as Leonard Bernstein, Jorge Bolet, and Wilhelm Kempff, favored Bechstein pianos. The State Ministry of Culture of the Soviet Union made a contract to supply major state philharmonic orchestras and concert halls across the USSR with three brands of pianos - Steinway & Sons, Blüthner, and Bechstein. Blüthner and Bechstein were also made the staple practice pianos at the Leningrad Conservatory and Moscow Conservatory, while most other music schools of the USSR were limited mainly to the Soviet-made pianos. Concert pianists, such as Dinu Lipatti, Shura Cherkassky, Tatiana Nikolayeva, Vladimir Sofronitsky, and Sviatoslav Richter, among others, often chose Bechstein pianos for their studio recordings.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall

In 1986, Karl Schulze, German entrepreneur and master piano maker, bought Bechstein and continued the legacy of fine piano making. Due to reunification of Germany and elimination of the Berlin Wall, the land formerly belonging to the Bechstein factory was used for new construction in the capital. In 1992 Bechstein started a new factory in Saxony for C. Bechstein and Zimmermann instruments. With investment of 15 million Euros this manufacturing site has become one of the world's most state-of-the-art factories for premium class instruments. Visitor groups are welcome. The manufacturing of Zimmermann instruments in Seifhennersdorf discontinued at the end of 2011.

In 1996, C. Bechstein went public. In 2003, Bechstein formed a partnership with Samick, in order to improve overseas distribution. Today, after the successful capital increase in 2009, Samick no longer has any shares. Nowadays major shareholders are Arnold Kuthe Beteiligungs GmbH as well as Karl Schulze and his wife Berenice Küpper, all Berlin investors.

By 2006, the company opened eight upscale showrooms and increased the number of Bechstein dealerships in major cities across Europe, North America and Asia. New Bechstein center were opened in recent years in New York, Moscow, Shanghai as well as partner centers in Kiev, Seoul, Sydney, and the Netherlands.

In 2007, the new C. Bechstein Europe factory was opened in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic. Bechstein has invested millions of Euros to build up a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing site especially for W. Hoffmann instruments. All brands and instruments made by C. Bechstein now exclusively originate from Europe.

Along with the company's economic success, C. Bechstein's concert grand pianos are making their comeback on international concert stages and in recording studios.

In 2006, the first international C. Bechstein Piano Competition took place under Vladimir Ashkenazy's patronage. National C. Bechstein competitions regularly foster the musical development of young artists.
Artcase pianos

Bechstein has been known as a maker of one-of-a-kind artcase pianos since the 19th century. Artcase pianos were commissioned by interior designers for royal palaces and fancy mansions. Artists and craftsmen were hired by C. Bechstein to make special pianos decorated with gold, hand-carved details, and hand-painted art on the piano case. Some of the artcase Bechsteins are now museum pieces, while others are sometimes traded at musical-instrument auctions, mainly in London and New York.

Performers

Students and followers of Hans von Bülow and Franz Liszt also developed loyalty to Bechstein pianos.

Alexander Scriabin owned a concert-size Bechstein at his Moscow home, which is now a national museum, and Scriabin's piano is still played at scheduled recitals. Tatiana Nikolayeva preferred the Bechstein for her acclaimed recordings of the music of Bach. Sviatoslav Richter grew up studying piano on a Bechstein and remembered his experience with that piano as stimulating and rewarding.

Claude Debussy said ""Piano music should only be written for the Bechstein"".

Edwin Fischer chose a Bechstein piano for his pioneering recording of Bach's The Well Tempered Clavier, as did Artur Schnabel for his cycle of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas. Both artists were very fond of Bechstein pianos, as were many of the 20th century's leading pianists, such as Wilhelm Kempff, Wilhelm Backhaus, Walter Gieseking and Jorge Bolet.

Polish pianist Władysław Szpilman (famous thanks to the movie The Pianist) used a Bechstein piano until 1941 in his family private apartments in Warsaw.

For his studio recording of the music of Chopin and Beethoven, Dinu Lipatti used a Bechstein piano.

Bob Dylan played a Bechstein piano at the ABC Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland on 20 May 1966. He is mentioned on many Bechstein dealers' web pages as a regular Bechstein player.When Dave Stewart of The Eurythmics listed his Bechstein piano for auction, he named Bob Dylan as one of the musicians who had played the piano.

The Bechstein concert grand at London's Trident Studios, over a century old and much sought-after for its sound, became one of the most frequently recorded instruments in rock history. The piano can be heard on The Beatles' ""Hey Jude,"" Elton John's ""Your Song,"" George Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass,"" David Bowie's ""Life on Mars?,"" Lou Reed's ""Perfect Day,"" Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" Carly Simon's ""You're So Vain,"" Nilsson's ""Without You,"" and Supertramp's ""Crime of the Century."" It saw service in the studio from 1968 until the mid 1980s, and has since been sold at auction.

Freddie Mercury of the British rock band Queen played a Bechstein piano on the best-selling album A Night at the Opera. (The liner notes to the album, as reprinted in the 2005 deluxe CD/DVD release of the album, credit Freddie Mercury with ""Bechstein Debauchery"".)

The music video for Elton John's ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"" features John playing a white Bechstein grand.

Oscar Peterson played and owned a Bechstein throughout much of his career, publicity contracts with rival manufacturers notwithstanding.

Anna Ivanova (2011) played Liszt's personal 1880 Bechstein grand piano, which is displayed in the Liszt Haus in Weimar (Germany). Recordings of her playing both this grand piano, and the Bechstein 576 (which was delivered March 17, 1862 to Franz Liszt), which presently is being displayed at the Bechstein Centre in Berlin, can be found on YouTube.
Awards

In 1862, C. Bechstein was awarded gold medals at the London International Exhibition.
In 2007, C. Bechstein received the iF Gold Award for C. Bechstein Piano Model Millennium.",0

rare ring that commemorates the naval hero, Horatio Nelson, who died in 1805 at the Battle of Trafalgar, fighting against the Napoleonic forces. Dr William Nelson, the admiral's brother, ordered 58 mourning rings for family and friends and every admiral and post-captain who fought at the Battle of Trafalgar . The ring is inscribed on the bezel ‘Trafalgar’; outside the hoop with Nelson’s motto in Latin, ‘Let him who earned it bear the palm [of victory]’, adopted by Nelson from a poem ‘Ad Ventos’ written in 1727 by John Jortin (1698-1770). Inside is the inscription ‘Lost to his country 21 October 1805, aged 47’. The initials N and B stand for Nelson and Bronte.

Admiral Nelson was given the title of Duke of Bronte in 1799 by the King of Sicily and in 1801 became a Viscount. The two coronets above the initials refer to these titles. Tthe motto Palmam qui meruit ferat (""let him who has earned it, bear the palm"") was added to his coat of arms in 1798 after the Battle of the Nile. Nelson was buried with full honours in St Paul's Cathedral. His cortege consisted of 32 admirals, over a hundred captains, and an escort of 10,000 soldiers.

This ring is an example of only fifty-eight that were made by Nelson's jeweller John Salter in 1806. Thirty-one were for Nelson's close family and friends, the rest for pall-bearers and other dignitaries (see The Nelson Dispatch, vol.3 pt.XII, oct.1990). Three similar examples of this ring are held extremely prestigious museums in the capital. One is in the Greenwich National Maritime Museum in London, another in The British Museum in London and another in the collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum, London, exhibited in the Jewellery Gallery, case 23, no. 8.

The ring has a particularly special provenance, arguably like no other mourning ring of Admiral Nelson’s. The ring belonged to the Reverend Alexander John Scott. The Reverend Alexander John Scott (1768-1840) was a British naval chaplain. He was appointed to the flagship H.M.S. Victory in 1803 where he served as private secretary to Lord Nelson. He was with Nelson when when he was shot on the quarter-deck of the Victory at the battle of Trafalgar on the 21st October 1805. Scott attended his dying chief in the cockpit of the flagship, receiving his last wishes. He refused to leave Nelson's body until it was brought back to England and placed in the coffin to lie in the Painted Hall Greenwich. 

The ring, lock of hair and music book were passed down by the direct descendants of the Reverend Alexander John Scott's family and eventually gifted to the previous owners. The music book was a personal possession of the Reverend which gives watertight provenance of the person who owned the ring. 

It is not clear exactly what Admiral Nelson’s last words really were although Scott documents  Nelson’s last words to be “God and my country“. However, it is also recorded that a statement during his last hours was ""Thank God I have done my duty.” Perhaps these two statements uttered in the last moments sound similar when mumbled by a feeble dying man. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy is that Scott remained by Admiral Nelson’s side as he died and his version is probably the most reliable.

The lock of hair is reputedly that of Lord Admiral Nelson. Without a DNA test there can be no conclusive proof of such. However, given that Reverend Alexander John Scott was with Nelson from the moment he was shot on the quarter-deck of H.M.S. Victory until the moment he was placed in his coffin, there is no reason to believe it is not a lock of Nelson’s hair. 

It is difficult to overstate the significance and rarity of Nelson’s mourning rings. With only fifty-eight made, the vast majority of them were given to close family members and only a few were given to close friends. A close friend who receives a morning ring of Nelson’s must have had an important role in his life and it is easy to imagine how close Reverend Scott was to Admiral Nelson seeing as he acted as his private secretary. The fact that three similar examples are in arguably the three most important museums in the UK bears testament to its rarity.

Mourning rings were used from the early seventeenth century to the end of the nineteenth century. Testators left money in their wills to have rings with commemorative inscriptions made and distributed to their friends and families. Simple bands enamelled with the name and life dates of the deceased were frequently made, sometimes set with a gemstone or a bezel set with a rock crystal covering a symbol such as a coffin or initials in gold wire. In the later 18th century, rings followed neo-classical designs, their oval bezels often decorated with the same designs as funerary monuments such as urns, broken pillars and mourning figures. Hair from the deceased was incorporated into the designs or set in a compartment at the back of the ring to give each jewel a uniquely personal element. Black or white enamel were favoured though white enamel was often, though not universally used to commemorate children and unmarried adults.

CONDITION

The overall condition of the ring is excellent. At one point in its lifetime the back of the ring has been cut to fit a larger finger. Considering that Reverend Alexander John Scott was only 37 years old when Lord Nelson died and 72 years old when he passed away himself, it is reasonable to assume that the ring had been cut to fit his own finger. It can be restored but as the item is of historical significance rather than a dress ring in our opinion it is best left as is.

The lock of hair is encased by domed glass on both sides, one side of which has cracked. The binding of the music book is in very poor condition, the front cover has come away altogether from the spine.

The carved and veneered surround comprising a moulded
shelf supported by a bold dentil cornice, above an inverted breakfront frieze carved with a central triglyph panel, flanked by a pair of rosettes carved in shallow relief, the frieze mounted with six carved hardstone profile portrait medallions of Roman Emperors, the stop-fluted jambs raised on moulded footblocks; in excellent condition with small restorations commensurate with age and use; the pale inclusions in the stone naturally formed.

This spectacular neoclassical marble chimneypiece is carved from Rosso antico, the frieze inset with six portrait reliefs of Roman Emperors, each carved in marmo giallo on a bardiglio background, five variously incised: VESPASIANUS, TIBERIVS, OTHO, JULIUS CAESAR, TITUS.

Rosso antico (marmor taenarium) is first recorded as being quarried in 1700 BC at Akra Tainaron (Cape Matapan), Greece.¹ The majority of this stone, however, was extracted throughout the Roman period, when it was one of the most coveted materials for carving due to its rich red colouring and association with highly prized Egyptian ‘Imperial’ Porphyry.² Rosso antico was chosen in antiquity for portrait busts, notably depicting Bacchic subjects such as Dionysus and satyrs due to its rich red wine colour which symbolised conviviality whilst conveying the education and cultivated taste of the owner.³ In the Renaissance, Rosso antico was also used for architectural detail on important buildings, such as the steps leading up to the choir in the medieval church of S. Prassede, and the large columns at the entrance to the Camera dell'Aurora.⁴

In 121 AD, G. Suetonius Tranquillus, secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote a biographical history of the first twelve emperors of Rome entitled De vita Caesarum (The Twelve Caesars). A Renaissance edition of Tranquillus’ work was published in 1470, followed by further reprints and translations into all the main European languages. Many of these were illustrated with prints of emperors taken from coins and statues, or imagined by the artist based on Tranquillus’ accounts. These interpretations were copied, in turn, by Renaissance designers for medals, Limoges enamels, and busts, as well as paintings such as the Eleven Caesars, a series of eleven half-length portraits of Roman emperors made by Titian in 1536–40 for Federico II, Duke of Mantua.⁵ These paintings were later given to King Charles I, before being passed in the Commonwealth to the Kings of Spain. Unfortunately, the series was destroyed in the catastrophic fire of 1734 at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, and is now only known through copies and engravings.⁶

From the middle of the 17th century until the end of the 18th century, there was an insatiable demand for marble carvings, often sold as Roman or assembled from ancient fragments, thus perpetuating the reverence for antiquity that was the quintessence of the Grand Tour. Rosso antico was in extremely short supply, even after the ancient quarries at Skutari were rediscovered in 1830, and remained one of the most highly valued of all stones. Described in 1776 as ‘dark red; scarce and dear’, it was mostly used for small objects such as Grand Tour desk ornaments, inevitably using material re-cut from classical fragments, due to its rarity, as was the case with porphyry.⁷ The portrait roundels on this chimneypiece are typical of those produced in Rome and Florence in hardstones, semi-precious stones, gold, silver, bronze, and mother-of-pearl, which, being easily transportable, would be taken home from the Grand Tour to be mounted within wooden, gilded or brass frames, as fashion dictated.⁸ A group of gold portraits of Caesars, dating from around 1660, are in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence. Images of Roman emperors were not limited to Italy, England and France, however, as examples executed in Deshima for the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie) show. Medallions depicting Roman emperors, invariably made of black and gold Japanese hiramakie or takamakie lacquer on copper, were produced for the Dutch market at the end of the 18th century. Examples can be found in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.⁹

There are two possible sources for the Imperial profiles on the chimneypiece: the engravings of The Twelve Caesars by Marcantonio Raimondi, or the Imperatorum Imagines by Hubert Golz.¹⁰ The portrait medallions also bear remarkable resemblance to a set of eighteen carved portrait reliefs of Roman Emperors, also of marmo giallo, almost certainly bought by David Ker (1742–1811) of Portavo, Co. Down, on his Grand Tour between 1792–4 in either Florence or Rome. Ker’s diary entry for 17th October 1793 is interesting as it reveals that he was offering his brother a choice of chimneypiece designs, which further supports a Roman origin for the offered example.¹¹ Indeed, fire surrounds incorporating antique fragments had been promoted from the late 1760s by Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–78), encouraged by Rome-trained architects including Robert Adam (d.1792). One such example, inset with mythological tablets carved from Rosso antico, was acquired by the 9th Earl of Exeter from Piranesi himself for Burghley House.¹² Another can be found at Islington House, Dorset.¹³ A third, inset with giallo antico and Rosso antico, follows Piranesi’s engraved design dated 1769 for a fire surround mounted with three marble portrait reliefs.¹⁴ It should be re-emphasised that Rosso antico was so precious that it was only ever used for small tablets or details rather than an entire chimneypiece, as with the offered example; likewise, while portrait reliefs are occasionally seen on the jambs of Italian surrounds, it is exceptionally rare to see the frieze mounted with a group, especially of this scale: the combination indicates an architectural commission by an extremely wealthy patron.

The sophisticated lines of this chimneypiece epitomise the French Empire influence on the Italian states at the turn of the 18th century. This idiosyncratic ‘Roman’ taste is encapsulated by that of Napoleon, who identified with Rome’s Imperial past. Napoleon’s desire to establish a visual link between himself and Roman emperors is demonstrated by the portraits of his court painter, Jacques-Louis David, inspired by portraits of Emperor Augustus. This Imperial taste extended to architecture, furniture and porcelain, the latter two of which are combined in a group of magnificent ormolu-mounted guéridons commissioned in Sèvres between 1803–11, made to immortalise Napoleon’s reign.¹⁵ The second guéridon in the series, the Table des Grands Capitaines (Table of the Great Commanders of Antiquity), commissioned in 1806, is made almost entirely of hard-paste Sèvres porcelain. The top, painted in imitation of sardonyx, is centred by a portrait cameo of Alexander the Great, surrounded by twelve smaller heads of commanders and philosophers from antiquity: Pericles, Scipio Africanus, Pompey, Augustus, Septimus Severus, Constantine, Trajan, Caesar, Mithridates, Hannibal, Themistocles and Miltiades.¹⁶ Louis XVIII presented the table to the Prince Regent (later King George IV) in 1817 as a token of appreciation for Napoleon’s defeat two years earlier, and George IV treasured it so highly that it became part of the ceremonial backdrop for all his state portraits. The table remains in the Royal Collection.¹⁷

This chimneypiece remained, until recently, in the possession of a noble Dutch family, who acquired it from the owners of a bombed Knightsbridge house in the 1940s; unfortunately, its provenance prior to this has been lost.

The use of Rosso antico on this scale, inset with these splendid Imperial profile medallions, appears unparalleled.

This magnificent piece was most probably made for a nobleman to present an array of gifts to someone.  Japanese culture demands high respect for one another and gifts were usually presented in pieces as amazing as the gifts themselves.
This piece is particularly special in that it consists of four large base pieces for storage and one gorgeous lid which ties the entire piece together.  The box consists of four sides each of which has a different subject hand-painted on it in a gorgeous blue color.  One side of the box shows an elderly couple standing under a tree by a flowing waterway, the next side shows the same waterway, just downstream with a branch hanging down, the third side shows a flowing river with a male and female Japanese Red Crowned Crane eating by the water, the final scene is a male and female box turtle resting on a rock underneath a tree branch with a flowing stream underneath them.  Each cartouche is hand-painted, while the rest of the box is beautifully decorated with blue and white flowing designs and Japanese inspired decoration.  The lid of the box is complete with a gorgeous sun shinning in the morning behind the trees.  The sections on the box rest on four gorgeously hand-painted blue and white feet.

This captivating and exquisite, hand-crafted, patinated bronze centerpiece serves as a remarkable focal point, adorned with marvelously hand-chassed and hand-chiseled dragons in relief, gracefully emerging and disappearing behind artfully stylized scrolling etched clouds. The centerpiece boasts a substantial and graceful curved base, complemented by a striking peaked and square-edged lip atop the vessel.

The significance behind the depiction of the three-clawed dragons stems from the Japanese belief that Eastern dragons originated within their native land. According to their folklore, as these majestic creatures ventured away from Japan, they acquired additional toes. The Japanese Sky dragon, associated with the realm of clouds and the heavens, is often portrayed without wings, despite their ability to soar through the sky. This aerial ability is attributed to a magical knot, known as Chi'ih muh, located atop their heads. 

The traditional depiction of Japanese dragons, akin to other Asian dragons, portrays them as slender and serpentine creatures, combining features from nine different animals. These elements include the chin whiskers of a deer, the head of a camel, the eyes of a rabbit, the neck of a snake, the abdomen of a cockle, the scales of a carp, the claws of an eagle, the paws of a tiger, and the ears of an ox. Throughout Japanese culture, dragons symbolize strength, courage, and enchantment.",0

Meissen Porcelain Figure of a Fisherman with a Net.  As one's gaze ascends, attention is drawn to the fisherman's head, crowned by a wonderfully crafted utilitarian straw hat. Beneath its brim, lustrous rich brown curls cascade, imbuing his countenance with a touch of allure. With his gaze directed downward, his beautifully painted face and eyes reveal a focused determination, guided by the pursuit of the catch nestled within a basket.

Clothed in an olive-hued robe, the fisherman embodies simplicity and authenticity, epitomizing a humble and unpretentious lifestyle. A tied rope secures his waist, exposing his left shoulder and further underscoring his connection to the sea. Poised upon his shoulder rests a sturdy stick, an essential tool for carrying the weighty wet fishing net, symbolizing the end of his arduous fishing endeavors. 

Standing gracefully upon a pedestal of sweeping stepped design, adorned with intricately painted sea plants and a repeating Neptune's trident motif, this Meissen figurine captures the essence of nautical beauty. Aesthetically captivating, the upper portion of the pedestal is encircled by elegantly rendered stylized blue waves, enhanced by gilded borders, inviting the viewer to immerse themselves in the maritime scene.

Partially concealed by a draped coral cloth, the fisherman holds a basket with contents showing tantalizing glimpses of multiple breeds of fish revealed with meticulous attention to detail. Their scales and expressive faces are rendered, with vibrant colors that evoke a striking resemblance to their natural counterparts. Such artistry infuses the scene with life, animating the tableau and enlivening the senses.",0

It is gilded with floral enamel paneling, referencing the 19th century.   The lyre is one of the oldest known stringed instruments, originally produced in the ancient river civilizations to honor the gods. Sumerian lures were quite rudimentary, formed by wooden framing inserted into a hollow basin, strings were wound around the frame to produce sound.   The instrument was played often accompanied by singing or spoken word. It was a significant, artistic way to retell stories, entertain, or provide ceremonial fanfare to social gatherings.

Lievre. This brilliant blue and white Japanese porcelain vase is a fine example of Japonisme decorative objects of the 19th century. Synthesizing Eastern and Western design motifs, this vase is a testament to cross-cultural artistic pollination.  The vase is supported by an ormolu mounted base 
 which features swirling impressions reminiscent of East Asian depictions of clouds. Similarly, the vase is topped by an ormolu cap with an intricate lace skirt around its perimeter. The gilt color of the top and base are a stark contrast to the rich blue and white porcelain vessel, decorated with bamboo imagery.

Bamboo is often depicted in Orientalist decorative arts as a symbol of strength, resilience, and adaptability. Bending but seldom breaking, the plant has miraculous integrity. Furthermore, the hollow interior of the bamboo plant and straightforward growth pattern remind us of the plant’s simplicity and openness to change.  Besides the ormolu top and base, the vase is painted solely by royal blue and white paint. The background is blue while the bamboo and scallop detailing along the neck are white. Blue and white porcelain, kosometsuke, originated from Chinese porcelain production during the Tang dynasty. Japanese decorative production saw a massive appreciation in the market for kosometsuke when European clientele became interested in the simple duo chromatic style. To this day it remains the most iconic color scheme of Orientalist art.

The original statue is one of the most famous pieces of the Louvre Museum in Paris. It was discovered on April 8, 1820 in the ancient city ruins of Milos, on the island of Milos in Greece.
It is believed that the statue was crafted between 130 B.C. and 100 B.C. by Alexander of Antioch, an artist who lived during the Hellenistic period. In the past, it was mistakenly attributed to the famous sculptor Praxiteles of Athens.

Introducing an exquisite pair of Japanese Imari porcelain vases from the Meiji period, circa 1880. Standing tall at 24.5 inches, they captivate with their timeless beauty.

The first thing that catches the eye are the striking cobalt blue stylized bands, adorned with stylized motifs like gilded lotus flowers, encircling the vases' short necks and lower sections. These bands serve as captivating frames for the enchanting hand-painted summer garden and tree of life scene that adorns the main bodies of the vases.

The masterful use of translucent cobalt blue toning in the tree of life motif, provides a sense of depth and substance. The entire vase is a vibrant garden tableau, teeming with a delightful array of birds, including the majestic phoenix. Amongst the colorful flowers, chrysanthemums and roses, in a delightful palette of hues, it feels as though one is truly immersed in a beautiful summer garden, with the tree of life rising majestically amidst the natural splendor.

The color scheme is tastefully complemented by a clean white background, enhancing the brilliance of the garden and its array of shades - from verdant greens to vivid oranges, blues, pinks, yellows, and delicate rust red buds.

The inner lip is adorned with delicate and repeating translucent rust red foliate motifs, adding a refined touch to these already captivating vases.

Truly a remarkable find, these hand-painted matching Imari Vases exude elegance and artistry, a piece of history that evokes the beauty and serenity of a Japanese garden in full bloom.

Step into the captivating world of Chinese artistry with this remarkable pair of cloisonné figures of cranes, hailing from the Qing Dynasty.  The red-crowned crane holds a special place in Chinese folklore, embodying notions of fidelity in marriage, good luck, long life, and love. In China, cranes have long been associated with immortality beliefs, revered for their long lifespan and wisdom. This pair of cranes is expertly fashioned from cloisonné enamel, showcasing exquisite hand-crafted enamel detailing that highlight their stylized feathers predominantly in white and dark grey, adorned with patches of blue, yellow, and green.

Each crane assumes a unique pose, exuding regal and refined charm, while both have their right foot delicately resting on handcrafted naturalistic rocks. The cranes stand gracefully upon black pedestals, elegantly elevated on tiny scrolled feet. Their bodies are crafted with predominantly white enamel partitioned by patinated cloisons, beautifully accentuated with black and grey feather highlights on their underside and long necks.  These double cranes are particularly rare, as they are less common than the single examples usually found. Noteworthy collections, such as the one owned by Mr. Robert Chang, have showcased similar single crane pieces, exhibited at prestigious locations like the Suzhou Museum from 2007 to 2008. Additional examples can be found in The Palace Museum, Beijing.

The vase is cast with taotie masks, the basin is impressed with religious symbolism, and the handles act as two opposing dragons. The various patterned elements on this vase encompass popular Chinese bronze casting and relief carving motifs.  This vase was later turned to a lamp without the need of comprimising the original piece.  The bronze vase is in original condition with minimal ware.

This particular vase is an ancient Chinese Zun, a ritual wine vessel characterized by a flared opening and bulging midsection. The outside of the vase features a high and low relief decoration that is significant to Chinese symbolism. Along the neck is a relief of twirling, whipping clouds: the winds of chi’i. On the large relief on the basin, there is a relief decoration with archaic motifs like taotie masks and stylized dragons. Vases were often made to furnish the tombs of the Chinese elite. Thus, these vessels were imbued with religious symbolism and imagery to evoke otherworldly spirits for good fortune in the afterlife.

Religious symbolism is an important aspect of this vase. The winds of chi’i on the neck represent the energy of the universe, while the dragon handles symbolize great power and strength. The taotie motif on the basin holds multiple meanings—it has been interpreted as “one of the four evil creatures of the world.” It is commonly represented on Chinese ritual bronze vessels to demonstrate their mystical power and their relationship between humankind and the afterlife.

Henry Dasson.  Presenting a truly exquisite pair of French Porcelain Ormolu Mounted Candelabras.  Henry Dasson is renowned for his exceptional bronze sculptures and acclaimed for the remarkable quality of his bronze work, particularly in the art of chiseling. At the 1878 and 1889 Paris Expositions Universelles, Dasson exhibited a number of pieces in the Louis XV and XVI styles, as well as pieces of his own modified eighteenth-century design.  These candelabras boast a seamless fusion of porcelain with Ormolu bronze mounts, meticulously hand-painted to showcase captivating motifs. The combination of a matte and burnished gold finish adds to their allure, exemplifying the artisan's meticulous attention to detail and superb craftsmanship. Each candelabra holds six candles, with gracefully curled arms adorned with foliate supporting the lower three, while the ends resemble the heads of birds of prey, lending a realistic touch to the overall design.

A captivating feature lies in the highly detailed finely carved mythical creatures and vegetation that is thoughtfully placed about the candelabras, On the upper body horned and bearded male masks proudly adorn the candelabra necks. Very fine grape vines and tendrils drop down from these masks, adding a touch of whimsy and intrigue. Adorning the lower body are wonderful lion-faced male masks with wings. At the pinnacle of each candelabra, a captivating ensemble of hand-carved Ormolu bronze summer vegetables and foliage adds a sweet and inviting touch.

Finely chiseled Ormolu bronze feathers form upturned groupings that create a sturdy pedestal, securely holding the deep cobalt blue porcelain bodies. The candelabra pedestals extend further down to plinths that rest on legs sculpted in the regal form of sphinxes, featuring feminine upper bodies adorned with braids and delicate facial features. Above the plinths, a band takes the form of a wheat wreath with berries, while the plinth itself boasts exquisite relief work depicting tiny grape vines. The elegant tails of the sphinxes gracefully curl out of sight under the base of the candelabra plinths, while finely carved wings showcase the artisans' remarkable skill. An ode to the artisan's pride in their work, each sphinx is marked with makers' dots underneath their paws. Every intricate detail, including the delicately crafted claws, exudes a level of sophistication that truly sets these candelabras apart.  The craftsmanship is undeniably extraordinary. Their round bulbous flask-shaped deep cobalt blue porcelain bodies are meticulously adorned with a collection of finely carved ormolu foliate and mythical creatures, creating a captivating and fabulous display.

Each of baluster form with everted crenelated mouth, gilt scroll handles as stylized lotus blossoms at the shoulder, a wide central band richly painted in colors with a dense wreath of field flowers reserved on the deep cobalt ground between gilt beaded bands and gilt stenciled shell lappets and flowers, the mouth, neck, shoulder and socle similarly gilt, the socle joined to the body of the vase with a knop quartered with bosses gilt with rosettes.
As the national porcelain manufactory of France, the Sèvres porcelain factory’s marks and backstamps mirrored changes in the government – hence the R.F. mark on a pair of vases dated 1849, the year after the beginning of the short-lived Second Republic and two years before its demise. Designed in 1840 by Jean-Charles-François Leloy (active at Sèvres as a designer of shapes 1818- 1844), the Vase Adélaïde was produced in two or three sizes. Examples of the largest are to be found in the collections of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam and at the Musée de Condé in Chantilly outside of Paris. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has two examples decorated in the same Limoges enamel style as that at Chantilly. One was acquired in 1844, the other in 1901 but they form a pair of the second size.
The Vase Adélaïde is named for Louise Marie Adélaïde Eugénie d'Orléans, Mademoiselle de Chartres, known as Madame Adélaïde (1777- 1847), younger sister of King Louis Philippe of France (1773-1850) who ruled France from 1830 until the revolution of 1848 brought in the Second Republic. Her brother’s closest confidant, she is recorded as having given him a pair of ‘her’ vases in 1840. In 1851, a coup by Napoleon III brought him to power, initiating the Second Empire. ",0

Ormolu Mounted Meissen Porcelain Sheep, Modeled by Kändler.  A delightful pair of Meissen porcelain sheep figurines, expertly modeled by the renowned artist Johann Joachim Kändler. Originally housed in a museum, their authenticity is underscored by the presence of distinctive red-inked inventory numbers.   Each gracefully poised on an oval base adorned with meticulously crafted porcelain flowers. The delicate petals, rendered in a myriad of colors, include the elegant bloom of roses, creating a harmonious blend of nature's beauty.

The figurines have support in the form of foliate and tree stumps, fashioned with a naturalistic touch that seamlessly integrates with the scenic landscape. The porcelain canvas is left refreshingly unadorned in parts, providing a striking fresh white backdrop to the sporadic bursts of color depicting leaves, flowers, and the charming sheep.  Positioned on their respective porcelain grounds, the figures are elevated by an ormolu mount with a scalloped stylized foliate trim that curls over the edges, adding a touch of opulence to the composition. The sheep, each with distinct brown patterns on their wool coats, captivate with adorable pink noses and expressive faces that seem to engage in a charming exchange when in close proximity.

Each of these magnificent Meissen vases are beautifully made by covering the entirety of the vases with individually hand-carved and hand painted porcelain flowers.  The word ""schneeballen"" is German for snowball, which relates to the slightly blue tinged balls of flowers which protrude off the body of the vases.

The schneeballen porcelain technique was first conceived by the illustrious Meissen Porcelain artist Johann Joachim Kændler in the mid 1700's.  It is considered one of the most beautiful and desired models made by Meissen to date.  When the schneeballen technique was created, royalty from around the globe was made aware of its majestic beauty and King Frederick commissioned six schneeballen vases to be made and called them ""synthesis of art and nature"".

Gorgeously decorated with an array of hand-craved and hand-painted individual porcelain flowers which are each individually applied to the larger porcelain bodies.  To elevate these pieces further,  the vases are further decorated with life-like vines and leaves which run around the bodies and rest on the flowers.  Resting atop each of the vases are two parrots, each hand-carved and hand-painted to perfection.  Pairs of this size, quality, and condition are very difficult to find, especially based on their age.  Meissen produces the highest quality European porcelain and each of their pieces is of the best quality.  The vases are further adorned with 24K hand-painted gilt decoration.

Possibly Huanghuali. Standing tall the pedestals exude an air of sophistication, with matching designs that showcase hand-carved geometric detailing around the skirt, toward the top of each leg and on the feet. Below the detailing, on the upper legs they become slimmer, culminating in expertly hand-carved feet adorned with similar but smaller geometric square scrolls.  The hardwood used in these pedestals has a marvelous aged deep dark reddish brown hue. The patina of time has enhanced the hardwood's natural beauty, further contributing to their appeal.

The skirts of the tables feature a repeating pattern of small geometric square scrolls, skillfully dipping towards the center, with a lovely small central sun motif. This understated and elegant design showcases the artisan's dedication to creating a harmonious and visually striking geometric composition. The pedestal tops are thoughtfully crafted with a lip and groove below the edges, creating an elegant appearance.  Remarkably preserved, these tables are in exceptional condition, considering their age. The care with which they have been maintained throughout the years is evident, making them a true treasure for discerning collectors and antique enthusiasts alike.

Charles Ramage born 2nd September 1856 in North Berwick, son of William Ramage, quarryman and his wife Ann Greig. Charles was a plasterer to trade and during the season he was a licensed caddie on the West Links. He resided with his mother, step-brother Andrew Denholm and Charles Gibson at 42 Westgate, (now No.47) North Berwick. Charles Gibson, a 22-year-old golf clubmaker from Musselburgh was employed by Tom Dunn in his workshop beside the first tee on the West Links, North Berwick. Charles Ramage's sister Helen born 5th June 1853 married Charles Gibson in the Abbey Church, North Berwick on 30th December 1881 and they set up home at 27 Westgate, North Berwick before moving to Devon in 1889.
Charles 'Chas' Ramage's neighbour at 41 Westgate was Tom Arundel, a clubmaker who was the first player to enter the Open Championship from North Berwick in 1879. The adjacent property was occupied by Ben Sayers and his family for a short period.
Charles Ramage married Bessie Scotland from Kinross in 1884 and they resided at 23 Quality Street, North Berwick. In 1886 Charles Ramage worked as a clubmaker with Tom Dunn and was a fine 'bulger' maker (a driving club with a convex face). In 1888 he was the first professional and clubmaker to be appointed to the newly opened nine-hole-course at Brighton & Hove Golf Club. In 1891 the members organised a professional tournament played for £10. The field included Charles Ramage, Douglas Rolland, Peter Paxton (winner), Tom Dunn, Charles Gibson, George Douglas, David Pinkerton, Alex. Alexander, Ramsay Hunter, Rowland Jones. During this period Charles and Bessie resided in Cowpie Road, before they moved to 49 Fonthill Road, Hove, Sussex.
In 1891 Charles was joined at Brighton by his step-brother Andrew Denholm as his assistant. The course commanded stunning views over the Sussex Downs and was served by the Brighton & Dyke Railway. Andrew Denholm born 23 September 1861, in Edinburgh son of George Denholm, gardener and his wife Ann Ramage. Andrew Denholm was an original member of the PGA and played in the Open Championship in 1900 and 1904. Charles Ramage died suddenly in 1893 aged 36 years and Andrew Denholm took over as professional and clubmaker at Brighton & Hove. In 1908, Andrew Denholm played in an exhibition match with James Braid who redesigned the nine-hole course. Andrew Denholm and James Braid beat J.H. Taylor and Charles Parsons.

This crystal pair of gymnasts is a sculpture by Renato Anatra and is a dynamic, elegant display of artistry and acrobatics. Produced in the Hollywood Regency style, this sculpture is a quintessential example of Mid-Century Modern aesthetics and social interests. 

The couple is seen in an acrobatic embrace: the figure standing on the plinth leans back to support the weight of the second figure whose body forms an aerial semicircle. Torsos in direct contact, the positioning of the figures is intimate, jubilant, and expressive. When the two figures are separated, the standing figure stretches out its arms, gazing to the heavens, while the second figure forms an arch on the ground beneath the plinth.  Signed by the artist on the plinth, the sculpture is one of Renato Anatra’s finest. As a prolific Italian glassblower, Anatra is known for his work’s fluidity, physicality, and romance.

This impressive set consists of three pieces: a center clock and two candelabras, each adorned with the most intricate and delicate details that have been executed to perfection.  Each three armed candelabra is remarkably elaborate with foliate arms that are embellished with gilt-covered beautifully twisted branches and curling leaves on an ornate botanically-inspired base. Embraced by the arms of the candelabras are two 18th Century Meissen Porcelain figures of musical lovers, dressed in brightly detailed traditional clothes.

The round clock face, with roman numerals, a white base, and ornate hands is surrounded by a flourish of gorgeous gilt foliage, exuding an air of elegance and refinement. Perched atop the clock is a stunning Meissen Porcelain figurine of a beautiful woman posed in mid-movement, her dress aflutter, and baring her leg as she gazes up at her left hand which is holding a bunch of grapes, while also grasping a wine goblet in her lowered right hand, representing the festivities of the moment. Surrounding the clock and extending down both sides the gilt foliate leads the eye to two cherubs each admiring tiny vases of exquisitely detailed flowers.  Below the cherubs, on either side, are four white ceramic pillars wrapped in a spiral of vines with blue, yellow, and burgundy blossoms, adding a touch of whimsy and playfulness to the design. Directly in the middle of the pillars and below the main clock face are two cherubs embracing amidst a flurry of blossoms and seated on an ornate white bench. On either side of the seat, more tiny cherubs can be found.  With 18th C. blue crossed swords mark on reverse.

Provenance: Alexander Scrimgeour, Highgate and subsequently Wispers House

Ruth Scrimgeour, and thence by descent. 

In the 1860s these globes were owned by Alexander Scrimgeour, a stockbroker, who lived with his seven children lived at Woodside, Highgate.  He bought the Stedham Estate in 1875 and had Wispers House built in the mock Tudor style, as his main residence, by Richard Norman Shaw.  Woolhouse Farm on the estate lay directly below Wispers and in 1897, Mr Scrimgeour gifted this to his daughter Ruth, with the globes and other antiques.  Ruth Scrimgeour kept a schoolroom in her farm until the 1930s, and established a pony and horse-breeding establishment and children’s riding school on her marshland on Selsey Bill.  

The Newton family are ranked among the leading English globe makers.  John Newton (1759-1844) trained under Thomas Bateman before founding his own company in 1780.  In the early 1800s John, and his second son William (1786-1861), relocated to 97 Chancery Lane and traded under the name J & W Newton.  From 1831 to 1841 another partner was added, civil engineer Miles Berry, and the company became Newton, Son and Berry.  After 1841 ownership passed to the eldest son William Edward Newton (1818-1879).  It was customary to update globes with the latest discoveries and stars by applying new papers as soon as they were published, hence the varying dates on these globes.",0

John Adams (1767-1829)

John Adams (known as Alexander Smith) was the last survivor of the Bounty Mutineers, the disaffected crewmen, who, led by acting-Lieutenant Fletcher Christian, seized control of the ship from their captain, Lieutenant William Bligh, and set him and eighteen loyalists adrift in the ship’s open launch.

After a sojourn in Tahiti, Christian, the remaining mutineers and some native Tahitians, mainly women forcibly abducted, left on 22nd September 1799 in search of safe haven. He then formed the idea of settling on Pitcairn Island, far to the east of Tahiti; the island had been reported in 1767, but its exact location was never verified. After months of searching, Christian rediscovered the island on 15 January 1790, 188 nautical miles east of its recorded position. This longitudinal error contributed to the mutineers’ decision to settle on Pitcairn in the hope they would be undetected. On arrival the Bounty was unloaded and stripped of most of its masts and spars, for use on the island. It was set ablaze and destroyed on 23rd January 1790.

Although the settlers were able to survive by farming and fishing, the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among the settlers. Alcoholism, murder, disease and other ills had taken the lives of most of the mutineers and Tahitian men. John Adams, Ned Young, and Matthew Quintal were the last three mutineers surviving in 1799 when the thuggish Quintal, while drunk, reportedly threatened to kill the entire community if he could not have Fletcher Christian’s widow as his own consort, and in response Adams and Young lured him to Young’s house and killed him with a hatchet. Having taken effective control of the 19-member strong colony after the 1793 massacre, Adams and Young then turned to the Scriptures using the ship’s Bible as their guide for a new and peaceful society. As a result, Adams and Young embraced Christianity and taught the children to read and write using the Bible. Young eventually died of an asthmatic infection in 1800, but Adams continued his work of educating the women and children. The Pitcairners also converted to Christianity. The Pitcairners would later convert from their existing form of Christianity to Adventism after a successful Adventist mission in the 1890s.

The American sailing ship Topaz was the first to rediscover Pitcairn in 1808. Adams was eventually granted amnesty for the mutiny. On 17 December 1825 Adams was married to Teio, or ‘Mary’. Teio had already borne Adams’ only son, George Adams, in 1804. Adams’ grave on Pitcairn is the only known grave site of a Bounty mutineer. It has a replacement headstone, the original lead covered wooden grave marker having been taken back to Britain where it is now on display in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London.

The main settlement and capital of Pitcairn, Adamstown, is named after Adams.

Barkcloth

The barkcloth, or ahu in Tahitian, provided the principal material for clothing throughout the Society Islands, and could also be hung ornamentally, used as a partition or as bed-sheets.  Barkcloth was produced by women using strips peeled from the soft inner bark of the tree – the Paper Mulberry, Bread-fruit and Fig were used. These strips were then soaked for several days before being beaten together into a continuous sheet using wooden beaters.

More about Accolay pottery:

Under the term Poterie d'Accolay or Accolay pottery, we group together the production of a community of potters settled in the village of Accolay, in the department of Yonne. This production center was created by four former students of Alexander Kostanda.

Active from 1945-1983, their pottery is distinguished by a great technical inventiveness and an extremely abundant production. The pottery community exploited the proximity of the National 6 (can be compared to Route 66 in the USA) by investing in the service stations to make permanent exhibition places on the circuit of migration of Parisian tourists. Their exhibition buildings, inspired by the construction of the 24h circuit of Le Mans, became the obligatory stage for holiday makers in transit. The National 6 joins the 7 known as the sun route.

This form of marketing continued at the entrance to Vermenton until the closure of factories in 1983. The creation of the Lyon motorway had however for several years derived the flow of tourists.

The forefather Alexandre Kostanda (Dec 1921 - Nov 2007) was born in Poland of Russian parents. The family emigrated to Lorraine in France, where his mother Irene worked as a decorator in a porcelain factory. They then moved to Vallauris, where his mother worked at Louis Giraud's workshop. Alexandre joined the company as an apprentice from 1936-1938. After the war he taught pottery at the Longchamps Pottery Training Section near Dijon and at the School of Decorative Arts in Beaune. He also had his own studio at Cluny and it was here that he trained the four young men who were to form the Accolay Pottery company - Dangon, Rodet, Palais and Boutaud. He returned to Vallauris in 1949 to run the Giraud pottery until he opened his own studio in 1953. 

His work often has a rustic appearance and he used clay from Cluny mixed with local Vallauris earth. He had exceptional technical expertise. Kostanda was instrumental in organizing the ceramic shows, now known as the Vallauris Biennale. His son Alexis is also a potter.

English, circa 1788.

Alexander Hood, Viscount Bridport (1726-1814) entered the Royal Navy in 1741, a few weeks before his elder brother Samuel, later Admiral Viscount Hood (1724-1816). Made post captain in 1756, Hood served through the Seven Years War commanding Minerva, 32 guns, at the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. In 1761, Minerva joined the squadron which escorted Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg to England for her marriage to King George III. In a further sign of royal favour, Hood was then given command of the royal yacht Katherine III. In 1780, he was made rear-admiral and, with peace, turned his attention to politics as member of parliament for Bridgwater in Somerset. In 1782, he joined the relief of Gibraltar in Queen, 90 guns. On 7 May 1788 he was made Knight of the Bath and, with the outbreak of war with France in 1793, hoisted his flag in Royal George, 100 guns. In April 1794, Hood was made admiral shortly before he fought at the Battle of the First of June for which he received a naval gold medal and was created Baron Bridport in the Irish peerage (matched in the British peerage two years later). In 1796, Bridport was placed in command of the Channel Fleet in which position he was soon thrust into the Spithead Mutiny when he adopted a sympathetic approach to the seamen’s grievances, earning their gratitude and respect. Until April 1800 Bridport maintained the blockade of Brest with never less than 28 warships, a highly complex and stressful task which, now in his seventies and after nearly sixty years of service, took a heavy toll on his health. Made Viscount Bridport in 1801, he retired to Cricket St Thomas, his home in Somerset, where he died in 1814. On his death, Bridport’s viscountcy lapsed, but he was succeeded as second Baron Bridport by his great nephew Samuel Hood, who married Charlotte Mary Nelson (1787-1873), only daughter of first Earl Nelson and niece of Admiral Viscount Nelson.",0

This painting is a 19th Century copy of Raphael's Madonna della Seggiola painted in 1514 and currently exhibited and part of the permanent collection at the Palazzo Pitti, Galleria Palatina, Florence, Italy. The bodies of the Virgin, Christ, and the boy Baptist fill the whole picture. The tender, natural looking embrace of the Mother and Child, and the harmonious grouping of the figures in the round, have made this one of Raphael's most popular Madonnas. The isolated chair leg is reminiscent of papal furniture, which has led to the assumption that Leo X himself commissioned the painting, circa 1890-1900.

Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (Italian, March 28 or April 6, 1483 - April 6, 1520), known as Raphael, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.

Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his death at 37, leaving a large body of work. Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career. The best known work is The School of Athens in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura. After his early years in Rome much of his work was executed by his workshop from his drawings, with considerable loss of quality. He was extremely influential in his lifetime, though outside Rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative printmaking.

After his death, the influence of his great rival Michelangelo was more widespread until the 18th and 19th centuries, when Raphael's more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models. His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles, first described by Giorgio Vasari: his early years in Umbria, then a period of about four years (1504–1508) absorbing the artistic traditions of Florence, followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome, working for two Popes and their close associates.

Raphael was born in the small but artistically significant central Italian city of Urbino in the Marche region, where his father Giovanni Santi was court painter to the Duke. The reputation of the court had been established by Federico III da Montefeltro, a highly successful condottiere who had been created Duke of Urbino by the Pope - Urbino formed part of the Papal States - and who died the year before Raphael was born. The emphasis of Federico's court was rather more literary than artistic, but Giovanni Santi was a poet of sorts as well as a painter, and had written a rhymed chronicle of the life of Federico, and both wrote the texts and produced the decor for masque-like court entertainments. His poem to Federico shows him as keen to show awareness of the most advanced North Italian painters, and Early Netherlandish artists as well. In the very small court of Urbino he was probably more integrated into the central circle of the ruling family than most court painters.

Federico was succeeded by his son Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, who married Elisabetta Gonzaga, daughter of the ruler of Mantua, the most brilliant of the smaller Italian courts for both music and the visual arts. Under them, the court continued as a centre for literary culture. Growing up in the circle of this small court gave Raphael the excellent manners and social skills stressed by Vasari. Court life in Urbino at just after this period was to become set as the model of the virtues of the Italian humanist court through Baldassare Castiglione's depiction of it in his classic work The Book of the Courtier, published in 1528. Castiglione moved to Urbino in 1504, when Raphael was no longer based there but frequently visited, and they became good friends. He became close to other regular visitors to the court: Pietro Bibbiena and Pietro Bembo, both later cardinals, were already becoming well known as writers, and would be in Rome during Raphael's period there. Raphael mixed easily in the highest circles throughout his life, one of the factors that tended to give a misleading impression of effortlessness to his career. He did not receive a full humanistic education however; it is unclear how easily he read Latin.

Early Life and Works

His mother Màgia died in 1491 when Raphael was eight, followed on August 1, 1494 by his father, who had already remarried. Raphael was thus orphaned at eleven; his formal guardian became his only paternal uncle Bartolomeo, a priest, who subsequently engaged in litigation with his stepmother. He probably continued to live with his stepmother when not staying as an apprentice with a master. He had already shown talent, according to Vasari, who says that Raphael had been ""a great help to his father"". A self-portrait drawing from his teenage years shows his precocity. His father's workshop continued and, probably together with his stepmother, Raphael evidently played a part in managing it from a very early age. In Urbino, he came into contact with the works of Paolo Uccello, previously the court painter (d. 1475), and Luca Signorelli, who until 1498 was based in nearby Città di Castello.

According to Vasari, his father placed him in the workshop of the Umbrian master Pietro Perugino as an apprentice ""despite the tears of his mother"". The evidence of an apprenticeship comes only from Vasari and another source, and has been disputed—eight was very early for an apprenticeship to begin. An alternative theory is that he received at least some training from Timoteo Viti, who acted as court painter in Urbino from 1495.Most modern historians agree that Raphael at least worked as an assistant to Perugino from around 1500; the influence of Perugino on Raphael's early work is very clear: ""probably no other pupil of genius has ever absorbed so much of his master's teaching as Raphael did"", according to Wölfflin. Vasari wrote that it was impossible to distinguish between their hands at this period, but many modern art historians claim to do better and detect his hand in specific areas of works by Perugino or his workshop. Apart from stylistic closeness, their techniques are very similar as well, for example having paint applied thickly, using an oil varnish medium, in shadows and darker garments, but very thinly on flesh areas. An excess of resin in the varnish often causes cracking of areas of paint in the works of both masters. The Perugino workshop was active in both Perugia and Florence, perhaps maintaining two permanent branches. Raphael is described as a ""master"", that is to say fully trained, in December 1500.

His first documented work was the Baronci altarpiece for the church of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino in Città di Castello, a town halfway between Perugia and Urbino. Evangelista da Pian di Meleto, who had worked for his father, was also named in the commission. It was commissioned in 1500 and finished in 1501; now only some cut sections and a preparatory drawing remain. In the following years he painted works for other churches there, including the Mond Crucifixion (about 1503) and the Brera Wedding of the Virgin (1504), and for Perugia, such as the Oddi Altarpiece. He very probably also visited Florence in this period. These are large works, some in fresco, where Raphael confidently marshals his compositions in the somewhat static style of Perugino. He also painted many small and exquisite cabinet paintings in these years, probably mostly for the connoisseurs in the Urbino court, like the Three Graces and St. Michael, and he began to paint Madonnas and portraits. In 1502 he went to Siena at the invitation of another pupil of Perugino, Pinturicchio, ""being a friend of Raphael and knowing him to be a draughtsman of the highest quality"" to help with the cartoons, and very likely the designs, for a fresco series in the Piccolomini Library in Siena Cathedral. He was evidently already much in demand even at this early stage in his career.

Influence of Florence

Raphael led a ""nomadic"" life, working in various centres in Northern Italy, but spent a good deal of time in Florence, perhaps from about 1504. Although there is traditional reference to a ""Florentine period"" of about 1504–8, he was possibly never a continuous resident there. He may have needed to visit the city to secure materials in any case. There is a letter of recommendation of Raphael, dated October 1504, from the mother of the next Duke of Urbino to the Gonfaloniere of Florence: ""The bearer of this will be found to be Raphael, painter of Urbino, who, being greatly gifted in his profession has determined to spend some time in Florence to study. And because his father was most worthy and I was very attached to him, and the son is a sensible and well-mannered young man, on both accounts, I bear him great love...""

As earlier with Perugino and others, Raphael was able to assimilate the influence of Florentine art, whilst keeping his own developing style. Frescos in Perugia of about 1505 show a new monumental quality in the figures which may represent the influence of Fra Bartolomeo, who Vasari says was a friend of Raphael. But the most striking influence in the work of these years is Leonardo da Vinci, who returned to the city from 1500 to 1506. Raphael's figures begin to take more dynamic and complex positions, and though as yet his painted subjects are still mostly tranquil, he made drawn studies of fighting nude men, one of the obsessions of the period in Florence. Another drawing is a portrait of a young woman that uses the three-quarter length pyramidal composition of the just-completed Mona Lisa, but still looks completely Raphaelesque. Another of Leonardo's compositional inventions, the pyramidal Holy Family, was repeated in a series of works that remain among his most famous easel paintings. There is a drawing by Raphael in the Royal Collection of Leonardo's lost Leda and the Swan, from which he adapted the contrapposto pose of his own Saint Catherine of Alexandria. He also perfects his own version of Leonardo's sfumato modelling, to give subtlety to his painting of flesh, and develops the interplay of glances between his groups, which are much less enigmatic than those of Leonardo. But he keeps the soft clear light of Perugino in his paintings.

Leonardo was more than thirty years older than Raphael, but Michelangelo, who was in Rome for this period, was just eight years his senior. Michelangelo already disliked Leonardo, and in Rome came to dislike Raphael even more, attributing conspiracies against him to the younger man. Raphael would have been aware of his works in Florence, but in his most original work of these years, he strikes out in a different direction. His Deposition of Christ draws on classical sarcophagi to spread the figures across the front of the picture space in a complex and not wholly successful arrangement. Wöllflin detects the influence of the Madonna in Michelangelo's Doni Tondo in the kneeling figure on the right, but the rest of the composition is far removed from his style, or that of Leonardo. Though highly regarded at the time, and much later forcibly removed from Perugia by the Borghese, it stands rather alone in Raphael's work. His classicism would later take a less literal direction.

Roman Period - The Vatican ""Stanze""

By the end of 1508, Raphael had moved to Rome, where he lived for the rest of his life. He was invited by the new Pope Julius II, perhaps at the suggestion of his architect Donato Bramante, then engaged on St. Peter's Basilica, who came from just outside Urbino and was distantly related to Raphael. Unlike Michelangelo, who had been kept lingering in Rome for several months after his first summons, Raphael was immediately commissioned by Julius to fresco what was intended to become the Pope's private library at the Vatican Palace. This was a much larger and more important commission than any he had received before; he had only painted one altarpiece in Florence itself. Several other artists and their teams of assistants were already at work on different rooms, many painting over recently completed paintings commissioned by Julius's loathed predecessor, Alexander VI, whose contributions, and arms, Julius was determined to efface from the palace. Michelangelo, meanwhile, had been commissioned to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

This first of the famous ""Stanze"" or ""Raphael Rooms"" to be painted, now known as the Stanza della Segnatura after its use in Vasari's time, was to make a stunning impact on Roman art, and remains generally regarded as his greatest masterpiece, containing The School of Athens, The Parnassus and the Disputa. Raphael was then given further rooms to paint, displacing other artists including Perugino and Signorelli. He completed a sequence of three rooms, each with paintings on each wall and often the ceilings too, increasingly leaving the work of painting from his detailed drawings to the large and skilled workshop team he had acquired, who added a fourth room, probably only including some elements designed by Raphael, after his early death in 1520. The death of Julius in 1513 did not interrupt the work at all, as he was succeeded by Raphael's last Pope, the Medici Pope Leo X, with whom Raphael formed an even closer relationship, and who continued to commission him. Raphael's friend Cardinal Bibbiena was also one of Leo's old tutors, and a close friend and advisor.

Raphael was clearly influenced by Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling in the course of painting the room. Vasari said Bramante let him in secretly. The first section was completed in 1511 and the reaction of other artists to the daunting force of Michelangelo was the dominating question in Italian art for the following few decades. Raphael, who had already shown his gift for absorbing influences into his own personal style, rose to the challenge perhaps better than any other artist. One of the first and clearest instances was the portrait in The School of Athens of Michelangelo himself, as Heraclitus, which seems to draw clearly from the Sybils and ignudi of the Sistine ceiling. Other figures in that and later paintings in the room show the same influences, but as still cohesive with a development of Raphael's own style.Michelangelo accused Raphael of plagiarism and years after Raphael's death, complained in a letter that ""everything he knew about art he got from me"", although other quotations show more generous reactions.

These very large and complex compositions have been regarded ever since as among the supreme works of the grand manner of the High Renaissance, and the ""classic art"" of the post-antique West. They give a highly idealised depiction of the forms represented, and the compositions, though very carefully conceived in drawings, achieve ""sprezzatura"", a term invented by his friend Castiglione, who defined it as ""a certain nonchalance which conceals all artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effortless ..."". According to Michael Levey, ""Raphael gives his [figures] a superhuman clarity and grace in a universe of Euclidian certainties"". The painting is nearly all of the highest quality in the first two rooms, but the later compositions in the Stanze, especially those involving dramatic action, are not entirely as successful either in conception or their execution by the workshop.",0

Artist Biography from the Guggenheim

Yaacov Agam

B. 1928, RISHON-LE-ZION, PALESTINE
Yaacov Agam was born in Rishon-le-Zion, Palestine (now Israel), in 1928, the son of a rabbi and kabbalist, Yehoshua Gibstein. He studied at the Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem under Mordecai Ardon in 1946, moved to Zurich and then Paris, and studied at the Atelier d'art abstrait and at the Académie de la grande chaumière. While in Zurich, he met and was influenced by artist and teacher Johannes Itten, who was propagating Bauhaus ideas; he also found inspiration in Vasily Kandinsky's defense of abstraction, ber das Geistige in der Kunst. Insbesondere in der Malerei (On the Spiritual in Art: And Painting in Particular, 1911).
His first solo exhibition was at the Galerie Craven in Paris in 1953, entitled Peintures en Mouvement (Paintings in movement), where he showed two series of early work. In one, grids of painted strips that incorporated different designs on opposite sides created images that merged and changed as spectators shifted their viewing position (a type of lenticular print that eventually became known as an Agamograph). In the other, his Transformable Pictures (Images transformables, 1953–61), viewers could manually activate works and rearrange their visual elements. While not the first Optical-Kinetic artist, Agam encouraged spectator participation at a time when such strategies were rare. He exhibited, along with other pioneers of Kinetic art including Alexander Calder and Jean Tinguely, at the Le mouvement (Movement) exhibition at the Galerie Denise René in 1955.
He continued to produce abstract, Kinetic work that incorporated light, sound, and viewer participation. He also produced many public commissions, including a moving salon environment at the Elysée Palace in Paris in 1972. In the space, walls were covered with lenticular imagery; transparent doors were included; and a sculpture was placed on a Kinetic carpet. In all, the environment shifted according to the viewer's position. In 1979, Agam was asked to make a work of art to commemorate the peacemaking efforts between Anwar el-Sadat and Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba, Israel. He created the Star of Peace, a Kinetic sculpture that appeared from one direction to be the five-pointed star of Islam, from another, the six-pointed Star of David, and from a third, a new star formed from their fusion. Other public projects include a 1987 memorial at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem for the victims of the Holocaust, and the world's largest menorah: a 32-foot, 4,000-pound structure at Fifth Avenue and 59th street in Manhattan, designed in 1977 and based on the original menorah in Jerusalem's Holy Temple.
Agam has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions at institutions including the Musée national d'art moderne, Paris (1972); Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (1973); Städtische Kunsthalle, Düsseldorf (1973); Tel Aviv Museum (1973); Jewish Museum, New York (1975); Palm Springs Desert Museum, California (1976); Museo de arte moderno, Mexico City (1976); National Museum of Art, Cape Town, South Africa (1977); Guggenheim Museum (1980); and Isetan Museum, Tokyo (1989). In 1996, UNESCO awarded Agam the Jan Amos Comenius Medal for the ""Agam Method"" for the nonverbal visual education of young children. Agam lives and works in Paris.

FANTASTIC and HISTORIC Early 19C American Hepplewhite Virginian Secretary Chest with OUTSTANDING Provenance.

This Secretary Chest was made in Virginia in the Early 19th Century, circa 1810.

It is made of cherry, walnut and maple and is most definitely in the Hepplewhite Style of the period, with it’s original Hepplewhite brass drawer pulls.

IT IS A REALLY INTRIGUING AND HISTORIC PIECE, ESPECIALLY, WHEN VIEWED IN CONTEXT WITH IT”S AMAZING PROVENANCE!

This piece was originally owned by Major William Alexander Obenchain who ‘hailed’ from the State of Virginia.

He was an engineer and was in the Virginia Corps of Engineers during the Civil War and served on General Robert E. Lee’s staff. It was acquired by him before the Civil War and we believe that this piece was on campaign with him during the War. We know for a fact that he fought at the Richmond Campaign in 1864, as we have, in our Collection, his original Field Map for that Campaign which ended the War.

It has remained in family ownership ever since.

It has come directly from the Family Estate, together with other VERY IMPORTANT items belonging to Major Obenchain and other IMPORTANT items that belonged to his wife, Eliza Calvert Hall-Obenchain. ALL these items contained in the Collection, are listed/posted individually on our Website.

The top drawer is on retractable curved side hinge supports and pulls outwards and drops to reveal a secretary and writing area.

The Bureau/Secretary Gallery has 6 drawers and 6 cubbies, a central tabernacle door with another drawer and 2 cubbies and this is flanked by 2 secret pull out compartments.

The central tabernacle door has it’s original key and working lock.

Closed, it is almost ‘flush’ like the rest of the drawers, with some very minor bowing through age.

The 3 drawers underneath are graduated in size and it ends with a serpentine shaped base and sits on four hand carved legs with original metal casters, marked ‘Universal 3’.

It has it’s original brasses and hardware throughout, save the addition to 2 contemporary replacement brass hinges to the drop down desk front, as the original hinges were broken, could not be repaired and were not supporting the weight of the drop down leaf.

Some minor repairs but not noticeable.

Otherwise, the piece is in it’s entirely, ORIGINAL condition!

What makes this piece even MORE INTRIGUING and APPEALING HISTORICALLY, are the 2 ‘historic’ circular holes on the piece:-

(1) in the back of the piece as seen in the photos. This hole is not symmetrical or fully round and appears to serve no purpose to the piece whatsoever. Sometimes, pieces have holes for wiring for lighting, put in them over the years, but this one never had such lighting or, indeed, any such explanation for this hole, AND

(2) the rear hole is replicated, in the corner portion of the bottom drawer and someone (a very long time ago) has used a tin can top, to cover the hole in the back of the drawer. The tin can top is period to the Civil War Era and is embossed “Minimum Volume 1 Pint”.

Our conclusion, is that (whilst we are, by no means ballistic experts) that these holes were created by musket balls, fired during one of the Major’s campaigns in the Civil War. It is entirely conceivable that this piece, being strapped into a covered wagon for carriage, would have been on it’s side. We are of the opinion that both holes, were caused or created by a musket ball entered the chest trough the base and back. We also believe that ‘the Major’, used what he had at his disposal on the battlefield, namely, a tin can lid to repair the hole in the drawer.

SO THIS PIECE IS A VERY SPECIAL PIECE OF US HISTORY, INDEED!
NOT ONLY IS IT AN EARLY 19th CENTURY AMERICAN PIECE, WITH A CONNECTION TO THE STATE OF VIRGINIA, THE CIVIL WAR, HISTORIC & IMPORTANT FIGURES IN THAT WAR AND IMPECCABLE PROVENANCE AND HISTORY!
IT IS TRULY UNIQUE!

The prominently displayed unsheathed sword signifies justice standing resolute and impervious to fear. Adjacent to him, the medallion of Augustus has been supplanted by a timepiece on the pillar.  The second putto, adorned in a delicate floral wrap, delicately holds foliate above the first, symbolizing the eternal dance of life while leaning on a pillar as an emblem of honor.

The incorporation of an Ormolu base, circa 1750, adorned with intricate cut-through scrolls and stylized curls, enhances the entire Meissen porcelain piece, emanating an aura of sophistication.

Galli. Flora's Embrace, an exquisite marble sculpture by the esteemed Professore Fortunato Galli, embodies a masterful union of beauty, nature, and the human form. This masterpiece stands as a shining example of Belle Epoque tradition, radiating a sense of timeless elegance and grace that transcends time and culture.

Professore Galli's exceptional craftsmanship is evident in every facet of this sculptural wonder. All hand-carved and hand-polished, the sculpture reflects an extraordinary level of artistry and dedication. Carrara marble, renowned for its purity and luminance, serves as the medium through which the sculptor breathes life into this magnificent creation. Each curve and contour is meticulously honed to perfection, capturing the interplay of light and shadow with unparalleled precision.

In Flora's Embrace, a nude woman stands with her arm gracefully extended, holding a vine of flowers. Her form, alluring and symmetrical, exudes a harmonious blend of strength and delicacy. The flowing drapery beneath her buttocks, hand-sculpted to mimic the gentle cascade of fabric, adds a dynamic and sensuous element to the composition, highlighting Galli's profound understanding of the interplay between marble and the illusion of softness.

Adorning the vine of flowers are an array of meticulously carved flowers and delicate butterflies, each a testament to the artist's attention to detail and devotion to realism. These natural elements, artfully integrated into the composition, symbolize the enduring connection between humanity and the organic world, evoking the timeless theme of the beauty found in the union of the human form and nature's elegance.

Flora's Embrace is a masterpiece that not only honors Professore Fortunato Galli's exceptional talent but also invites the viewer to contemplate the profound beauty and serenity captured within its elegant lines and sensual forms. This sculpture, meticulously hand-carved and hand-polished, offers an enduring invitation to explore the enchanting harmony of the human spirit and the natural world, forever celebrating the union of art and nature.

Each has a border of oak leaves and gilded acorns, a central fouled anchor within a victor’s laurel wreath and gilt borders.  The gilt inscriptions state ‘Nelson 2nd April Baltic’, ’15th Febry‘, ‘San Joseph’, and ‘Glorious 1st August’.  The saucer has two additional oak leaf reserves with banderols inscribed ‘Nelson San Joseph’ and ‘Nelson Aboukir’.  Circa 1802. 

The saucer diameter: 5in (12.5cm)  

Provenance: Contents of Bixley Manor by instruction of the executors of Sir Timothy Colman KG.

With a copy of the purchase receipt from Mortlock’s Ltd., dated August 1895.

The various Baltic and Nelson Services were presumably created in some haste ahead of the Lord Mayor’s inauguration, and it is likely that the London decorating workshop responsible used the only blank porcelain available to them, a mixture of Coalport and Paris porcelain.  The assemblage must have been very large as Nelson divided the amount between various relatives almost immediately.  One Baltic Set tea service was delivered to Merton, the house Nelson shared with Emma and is listed in the 1805 inventory.  Another, slightly larger, set belonged to Nelson’s sister, Catherine ‘Kitty’ Matcham, and this featured in Sotheby’s sale of ‘Nelson and the Napoleonic Wars, including The Matcham Collection’, 5th October 2005, lot 22.  It is conceivable her Baltic tea set had also been passed on to her by her brother because it was surplus to Nelson’s needs.  More of the set was given to Nelson’s brother, William.  William married Hilare Barlow, the daughter of Admiral Sir Robert Barlow GBC, in March 1829.

Porcelain from both the Nelson and the Baltic Services was inherited by Nelson’s niece, Charlotte Nelson, Duchess of Bronte.  Her son Alexander, from her marriage to Samuel Hood, Baron Bridport, inherited the majority of these pieces, many of which appeared in his sale at Christie’s in July 1895 and would explain the date of the Mortlock’s invoice.  Other pieces are in the Nelson-Ward Collection bequeathed to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, in 1946 by the grandson of Horatia, Nelson and Emma Hamilton’s daughter.",":

Some interesting facts of this original antique map:

1. **Ancient Civilizations**: It covers the heartland of some of the oldest civilizations in the world, including Assyria, Babylonia, and Armenia, with a history that stretches back thousands of years.

2. **Geographical Features**: The map shows significant geographical features such as the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the Caucasus mountain range, and the Black Sea (Pontus Euxinus), which were crucial to the development and sustenance of these civilizations.

3. **Historical Routes**: It likely outlines ancient trade routes, such as the Silk Road and other lesser-known paths that facilitated the movement of goods, armies, and ideas.

4. **Political Boundaries**: The boundaries indicated may reflect the political situation during various periods, such as the Assyrian Empire, the Kingdom of Armenia, or the Hellenistic states following Alexander the Great's conquests.

5. **Inset Maps**: If any, would provide a closer look at specific regions, illustrating the detailed knowledge of the area's geography during the time of the map's creation.

6. **Latin Labels**: The use of Latin in labeling and descriptions is characteristic of scholarly works of the 19th century, emphasizing the map's academic and educational purpose.

The period the map likely represents is the classical antiquity, particularly the era of Roman geopolitical interest in these regions, which might range from the 1st millennium BC to the first few centuries AD. This map would be of particular interest to those studying the ancient Near East and the complex interplay of cultures, empires, and trade that characterized the region.

The map is from the ""Spruner-Menke Atlas Antiquus,"" which is a historical atlas created by Karl Spruner von Merz, and later edited by Theodorus Menke. The atlas is known for its detailed maps of historical geographic regions, rendered with great precision and accompanied by scholarly research. These maps were particularly designed for educational use, providing a visual aid for the study of historical and ancient geography. The ""Spruner-Menke Atlas Antiquus"" is considered a significant work in the field of historical cartography and was published in the late 19th century.",0

A fantastic early Lingam model in an octagonal form on a square base which rises up to a rounded top. Around the rounded top is a thin engraved line which runs horizontally and vertically at one point. This engraving is indicative to a foreskin on a penis. The Lingam is made in three distinct sections which symbolize the amalgamation of the three major deities of the Hindu Trinity: Brahma, The Creator (the cube base), Vishnu, The Preserver (the mid-section octagon), and Shiva, The Destroyer and Renewer (the top portion of the abstracted phallus or penis, the rounded top part). Lingam's were very important to past Hindu culture. In ancient times, in the Hindu religion, sex and sexual body parts were an integral part of the religion. Lingam refers to an ""outward symbol"" of the ""formless reality"", the representation of merging of the realistic physical form (Prak?ti) with a formless Reality (Purusha) in an otherworldly context. Shiva, otherwise known as Mahadeva, is the Almighty G-D of destruction and renewal. Shiva is known to not have a Lingam, due to the fact that Shiva transcended above sexual organs. This statue and its counterpart, Yoni (Pindika), from the G-DDESS Shakti, represent human sexual organs and desires, which demonstrates the difference between man and G-D. Sexual desires and physical embodiments of sexual activities were integral parts of ancient religions, which later manifested into the religions that they are today.

Biography:

“André Kertész has two qualities that are essential for a great photographer: an insatiable curiosity about the world, about people, and about life, and a precise sense of form.” – Brassai
 
Known for capturing the essence of a moment, Andre Kertesz was considered one of the most influential photographers of the Twentieth Century. He was born in Budapest, Hungary on July 2, 1894; he died in New York City September 27, 1985.

Lyrical. Spontaneous. Andre Kertesz pictures of everyday life greatly influenced magazine photography in the United States and Europe as his distinctive style showed generations of photographers how to shoot without intruding in the situation or the emotion of the day. After being severely injured during WWI, he returned to Budapest. Surprising, his post-war career initially continued as a clerk on the Budapest Stock Exchange,

Kertesz moved to Paris in 1925 to work as a freelance photographer as artist and political freedom was lacking in his native Hungary. He soon made friends with some of the leading artists of the time including Fernand Leger, Marc Chagall, and Piet Mondrian. In 1928 he bought a Leica, a small handheld camera so small that he was able to comfortably hold it in his hand. This gave him the freedom to move about the streets of Paris. The camera enabled him to capture spontaneous moments of urban life, a subject that would fascinate him throughout his career. With his Leica and the friendship of these artists, he was able to develop a visual history of Paris. His work appeared in French, Italian, and British publications, including prominent magazines and newspapers of the day like the London Sunday Times.

At the onset of Hitler's Germany and the specter of war on the horizon, Kertesz moved to New York City in 1936 to pursue his career as a photographer. He became a United States citizen in 1944. In 1949 he became a staple with Conde Nast. Alongside Alexander Liberman, Kertesz helped to transform and elevate House and Garden Magazine into the publication envisioned by Mr. Liberman.

Once Kertesz retired from commercial work in 1962, his work began to be recognized as fine art photography. His personal projects harkened back to his early work in Hungary - street scenes, still-life and the movements of everyday people. Kertesz work is in numerous private and public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Art Institute of Chicago, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, CA ; Center for Creative Photography, Tucson, AZ; Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; Pompidou Center, Paris, France.

A wishbone, otherwise known as the furcular, is a forked bone found in birds and some dinosaurs. 

The main function of the bone is to provide strength between the neck and breast, to protect the creature during battle. 

The Ancient Romans perceived this bone as a symbol of luck which allowed the progression of breaking a dried chicken wishbone apart whilst making a wish; this procedure determined the person with the bigger half would receive their wish or have good fortune.

This tradition has travelled through Europe and is an adopted practice in many countries.

This gorgeous grand tour piece is modeled after the Fontane della Piazza Farnese, twin fountains located outside the Palazo Farnese in Rome, Italy. The shape of this marble bath is reminiscent of the ancient Roman baths of Caracalla.  Ancient Egypt and Rome saw the use of sarcophagi as ritual baths.  Neoclassical Italian furnishings evoke the sense of auspicious spirituality that originated in Ancient Rome. The sarcophagus as a source of mystical, inexplicable powers is an idea that grew from archeology during the medieval period. Recalling the supernatural ideology of the past, the production of this tub signifies the impact of ancient religion on subsequent societal generations.

This print depicts the Black-Cheek Cat Bird. Originates from 'A Monograph of the Paradiseidae, or Birds of Paradise'. 

This spectacular large folio lithograph is from Daniel Giraud Elliot's The New and Heretofore Unfigured Species of the Birds of North America. The work was published in New York for the author between 1866 and 1869. Each lithograph features original hand-coloring. The plates were predmoninantly executed by Bowen of Philadelphia after originals by Elliot and celebrated natural history artist, Joseph Wolf. It is believed only 200 copies of this work were ever printed. 

The work generally depicted life-size renderings of birds that were not previously illustrated by Alexander Wilson or John James Audubon. It had a particular focus on birds of the American West including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. It also depicts some birds from the Alaskand and Arctic regions. Many of birds were drawn from birds brought back from government-led expeditions in the West as well as private sources including John Xantus de Vesey. 

Elliot’s lithographs are some of the most valuable American bird plates. Elliot was a prominent American zoologist. He was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the American Ornithologists’ Union. Elliot was also curator of zoology at Chicago’s Field Museum. 

In the preface, Elliot describes his intentions for the work: ""Since the time of Wilson and Audubon, no work has been published upon American Ornithology, containing life-size representations of the various species that have been discovered since the labors of those great men were finished. The valuable productions of Cassin, as well as the revised edition of the ninth volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, the joint labor of Messrs. Baird, Cassin and Lawrence had indeed appeared . but no attempt had been made to continue the works of the first great American naturalists in a similar manner . It was, therefore, with the desire to contribute . towards the elucidation of the comparatively little known species of the Birds of North America, their habits and economy, as well as to render their forms familiar so far as life-size representation of them might serve to do, that I undertook the present publication.""

Artists and engravers: Lithographed plate by J.Smith after J. Wolf. Elliot's great work on the Birds of Paradise, one of the most admired bird prints ever produced.

Condition: Good, general age-related toning. Please study image carefully.

An English language hard bound compendium of sporting letters, dating to the Georgian period, published 1810.

An English novelist and art critic, William Beckford (1760 - 1844) was the son of a former London Mayor - the significant inheritance upon his father's death afforded Beckford a lifestyle conducive to indulgence in art and architecture. A brief dalliance as a pupil of Mozart gave way to following the tutelage of Alexander Cozens (1717 - 1786), a British landscape artist. His most notable written work is Vathek - a gothic novel started in French and first published in English without Beckford's name in 1786. Other titles by Beckford include Italy - with Sketches of Spain and Portugal, and the satirical novel Azemia.

Presented in good antique condition. Lightly time-worn and intact
Printed in London by Albion Press across 314 pages
Illustrations engraved and reproduced by John Scott
Hard bound with distinctive marble paper with gold tooling and titling
Frontispiece and illustrated title plates with delicate paper cover

by Charles-René de Paul de Saint-Marceaux

Cast by Barbedienne. The mischievous Harlequin, arms crossed in contemplation, wearing a grin and a mask, treading the boards of the stage, as befits his leading place in the Commedia dell'arte. Signed by the founder, Ferdinand Barbedienne, having the foundry cachet, and dated 1879, and the sculptor's name, St. Marceaux.

René de Saint-Marceaux (1845-1915)
Son of a Reims wine merchant, entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris under the tutelage of Jouffroy, exhibiting at the Salon of 1868, studying later in Italy. Considerable success followed, and he was awarded gold medals at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, having been elected as a Chevalier to the Legion d'Honneur in 1880, and later becoming an officer. His public Parisian works may be seen in the Champs-Elysees (Alphonse Daudet the noted novelist) and Alexander Dumas fils, in Montmartre and the Louvre. This figure 'Arlequin' is to be seen in Reims Museum, and Bucharest Arts Museum.

Original painted by Sir David Wilkie 1812. Engraved by Abraham Raimbach 1822. London published by Paul Jerrard & Sons.

“Abraham Raimbach (16 February 1776 in London – 17 January 1843), was an English engraver of Swiss descent. He was born in Cecil Court in the West End of London.[1] Educated at Archbishop Tenison's Library School, he was apprenticed to the engraver J. Hall from 1789 to 1796. For nine years, part of his working-time was devoted to the study of drawing in the Royal Academy and to carrying out occasional engravings for the booksellers, whilst his leisure hours were employed in painting portraits in miniature. Having formed an intimacy with Sir David Wilkie, Raimbach in 1812 began to engrave some of Wilkie's best pictures. At his death, he held a gold medal awarded for his Village Politicians at the Paris Exhibition of 1814. He was elected corresponding member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1835.[2] He is buried in St Mary's Churchyard, Hendon.”

“Sir David Wilkie was a Scottish painter, who was the son of the parish minister of Cults in Fife, Scotland. He developed a love for art at an early age. In 1799, after he had attended school at Pitlessie, KingsKettle and Cupar, he was given permission by his father to become a painter. Through the influence of the Earl of Leven Wilkie was admitted to the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh, and began the study of art under John Graham. 

He became a special admirer of the works of Alexander Carse and David Allan, two Scottish painters of scenes from humble life. A scene from Allan Ramsay, and a sketch from Macneill's ballad of Scotland's Skaith, afterwards developed into the well-known Village Politicians, were the first subjects in which his true artistic individuality began to assert itself.

In 1804, Wilkie left the Trustees' Academy and returned to Cults where he established himself in the manse, and began his first important subject-picture, Pitlessie Fair, which includes about 140 figures, and in which he introduced portraits of his neighbors and of several members of his family circle. In addition to this elaborate figure-piece, Wilkie was much employed at the time upon portraits, both at home and in Kinghorn, St Andrews and Aberdeen.

In the spring of 1805 he left Scotland for London, carrying with him his Bounty-Money, or the Village Recruit, which he soon disposed of for £6, and began to study in the schools of the Royal Academy. Wilkie now turned to historical art, and painted his Alfred in the Neatherd's Cottage. His subsequent success was rewarded by professional honors. In November 1809 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy of London*, when he had hardly attained the age prescribed by its laws, and in February 1811 he became a full Academician. In 1812 he opened an exhibition of his collected works in Pall Mall, but the experiment was unsuccessful, entailing pecuniary loss upon the artist.

In 1814 he executed the Letter of Introduction, one of the most delicately finished and perfect of his cabinet* pictures. In the same year he made his first visit to the continent, and in Paris entered upon a profitable study of the works of art collected in the Louvre. In 1816 he made a tour through Holland and Belgium in company with Raimbach, the engraver of many of his paintings, and from this time for the next decade traveled in Europe including Italy, Switzerland and Spain.

He became a noted painter of genre, portraits and historical scenes referencing the places he visited. In the beginning of 1830 Wilkie was appointed to succeed Sir Thomas Lawrence as painter in ordinary to the King of England, and in 1836 he received the honor of knighthood.

In the autumn of 1840 Wilkie went on a voyage to the East. Passing through Holland and Germany, he reached Constantinople, where, while detained by the war in Syria, he painted a portrait of the young sultan. He then sailed for Smyrna and traveled to Jerusalem, where he remained for some five busy weeks. The last work of all upon which he was engaged was a portrait of Mehemet Ali, done at Alexandria. On his return voyage he suffered from an attack of illness at Malta, and remained ill for the remainder of the journey to Gibraltar, eventually dying at sea off Gibraltar, en route to Britain, on the morning of 1 June 1841. His body was consigned to the deep in the Bay of Gibraltar. Wilkie's death was commemorated by the English painter Joseph Mallord William Turner in the oil painting titled Peace -Burial at Sea.”

This unusual and quite rare set is made up of two of the rarest and most desirable Sevres models to have ever been produced by the Sevres porcelain company. The center object, known as a pot-pourri gondole, was produced by the Sevres company in 1757-1758 for King George IV, and is one of only three pink ground Sevres porcelain objects still in the Royal Collection. This particular pot-pourri model is considerably complex to produce, as the top is in the form of a pierced-onion with circular open-work holes intended for use with hyacinth flower bulbs. This particular model is decorated in a gorgeous pink-ground with the main panels decorated in hand-painted decorations of three putti's in the clouds playing with one another. The pot-pourri is further decorated white paneled sections filled with hand-painted flowers. The piece is further adorned in 24K gold decoration. The lid is encrusted in all hand-painted porcelain flowers of all shapes and sizes. The form of this pot-pourri bares resemblance to the Venetian gondola, for which royalty adored.

The candelabras of this marvelous set hold their own as extraordinary and of the most sought-after form produced by the Sevres company. These were produced around the same time as the pot-pourri , in 1758 by Jean-Claude Duplessis, one of the foremost ceramic porcelain modelers for the Sevres company from 1748-1774. The candelabras are called, vase à tête d'éléphant, which translates to elephant head vase. These were originally designed as vases with an intent to place candelabra arms on them, and this pair is of no exception with gorgeous candelabra arms which continue from the trunks of the elephant heads. These candelabras are truly incredible with a pink-ground, hand-painted panels of multiple putti's playing in the clouds, a gorgeous base with white accents, and to top it off, each section is hand-painted with multi-colored flowers and finished in 24K gold. The bottoms of each of this marvelous pieces are marked in gold with French porcelain marks. Sets like this garniture are extremely rare and even more difficult to find in this quality and condition.

This fine sculpture is a cast of Richard Alexander Hudnut's hand and was produced by the renowned Montagutelli Frères foundry in Paris in 1912.

The sculpture is in very good vintage condition, signed ""Richard Alexander Hudnut 1912"" and carries the oval ""Montagutelli Freres Paris Cire Perdue"" foundry stamp to the underside.

Richard Alexander Hudnut (1856-1928) was an American businessman recognised as being the first American to achieve international success in cosmetics manufacturing. After graduating from Princeton University, he toured France and returned with the idea of introducing French-style perfumes and cosmetics to American women. The Richard Hudnut company once maintained separate US and European headquarters on Fifth Avenue in New York City and on the Rue de la Paix in Paris, respectively. Although his fortune had been built around cosmetics and beauty products, he preferred to be known as a ""perfumer"". (Wikipedia)

Montagutelli Frères were famed at the time, for having been one of the few Parisian foundries capable of producing bronze casts using the demanding lost-wax casting technique, and briefly produced busts & statuettes for Auguste Rodin around this exact period (1912-13). Run by two brothers, this firm cast all three of the only lost-wax pieces by Rodin in the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) London collection and many others that are now included in private collections and major art institutions, such as the Rodin Museum in Paris and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, PA.

The practice of 'life casting' was popular in bourgeois circles, and was popular with artists, political, literary or society figures.",0

Old bird print depicting two White-Headed Woodpeckers. This print originates from 'The new and heretofore unfigured species of the birds of North America', published 1866-1869.

This spectacular large folio lithograph is from Daniel Giraud Elliot's The New and Heretofore Unfigured Species of the Birds of North America. The work was published in New York for the author between 1866 and 1869. Each lithograph features original hand-coloring. The plates were predmoninantly executed by Bowen of Philadelphia after originals by Elliot and celebrated natural history artist, Joseph Wolf. It is believed only 200 copies of this work were ever printed. 

The work generally depicted life-size renderings of birds that were not previously illustrated by Alexander Wilson or John James Audubon. It had a particular focus on birds of the American West including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. It also depicts some birds from the Alaskand and Arctic regions. Many of birds were drawn from birds brought back from government-led expeditions in the West as well as private sources including John Xantus de Vesey. 

Elliot’s lithographs are some of the most valuable American bird plates. Elliot was a prominent American zoologist. He was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the American Ornithologists’ Union. Elliot was also curator of zoology at Chicago’s Field Museum. 

In the preface, Elliot describes his intentions for the work: ""Since the time of Wilson and Audubon, no work has been published upon American Ornithology, containing life-size representations of the various species that have been discovered since the labors of those great men were finished. The valuable productions of Cassin, as well as the revised edition of the ninth volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, the joint labor of Messrs. Baird, Cassin and Lawrence had indeed appeared . but no attempt had been made to continue the works of the first great American naturalists in a similar manner . It was, therefore, with the desire to contribute . towards the elucidation of the comparatively little known species of the Birds of North America, their habits and economy, as well as to render their forms familiar so far as life-size representation of them might serve to do, that I undertook the present publication.""

This wonderful souvenir handkerchief has been newly framed in a shadow box frame and is mounted onto a linen background. The handkerchief is printed with an image of Lord Roberts of Kandahar in his military regalia with the words 'India 1879-1893, South Africa 1900, Lord Roberts of Kandahar' around the image. Kandahar and skiing are synonymous with each other after Lord Roberts lent his name to the world's very first downhill ski race in Montana-sur-Sierre, Switzerland. The winner was awarded the trophy known as the 'Roberts of Kandahar Challenge Cup' which is used to this day for the premier of world downhill racing. In January, 1924, a group of British alpine ski pioneers decided to form a ski club at Muren, Switzerland, 'The Kandahar Ski Club'.

To skiers and non-skiers alike, the name Kandahar generally is a puzzle and 
rightfully deserves an explanation. First of all, Kandahar (which is a corruption of Alexandria) is the name of a town in Afghanistan actually founded by Alexander the Great during his monumental march Eastward to India and beyond.

Now, the tenuous link between the town of Kandahar and skiing is provided centuries later by British General Frederick Sleigh Roberts who, in August, 1880, marched 10,000 men from Kabul to Kandahar, a distance of 313 miles, in 22 days to relieve the siege of a British Garrison stationed there. A grateful British government chose to knight him for this effort in 1882, and, in keeping with custom, he chose the name of one of his campaigns. Thus, the general became the first Lord Roberts of Kandahar.

Lord Roberts became vice-president of the Public Schools Alpine Sports Club in 1903 and eight years later, on January 11, 1911, a group of Englishmen held the world's very first downhill ski race in Montana-sur-Sierre, Switzerland, and Lord Roberts lent his name to the ski trophy awarded to the winner. This trophy was known as the Roberts of Kandahar Challenge Cup and is used to this day for the premier of world downhill racing.
Finally, in January, 1924, a group of British alpine ski pioneers decided to form a ski club at Muren, Switzerland, and for want of a better name decided to simply take the name Kandahar and use a block 'K' for a patch, thus starting what is undoubtedly the most famous ski club in the world. The Kandahar Ski Club was then instrumental in organizing the first international ski meet ever to be decided on the combined result of both downhill and slalom races. From that day forward a ski race meet was known simply as a Kandahar!
The driving force behind the Kandahar Ski Club was Sir Arnold Lunn, the man who invented and named the slalom ski race. Strangely enough, Sir Arnold always regretted his attaching the old Norwegian name slalom to his invention, recognizing that the German world torlauf (gate race) would have been far more appropriate.
On March 3 and 4, 1928, Sir Arnold and his friend Hannes Schneider inaugurated and supervised the first Arlberg-Kandahar race in St. Anton, Austria, a full two years before the FIS recognized downhill and slalom racing and three years before the first World Championships in the Alpine Combined.",0

Sort of an Irish Oushak with a slate blue ground displaying a repeat of semi-geometric buds and flowers along with sawtooth medallions. Unlike other Donegal's, there is nothing Celtic about this unique carpet. The palette is a variant on blue and white, but not oriental. The narrow orders just barely constrain the dynamic field which pushes underneath in all directions. The spacious layout makes the carpet seem larger than it is. The Arts and Crafts movement originated in England in the second half of the 19th century as a reaction against mass-produced machine-made goods. William Morris, the founder of Morris and Co., designed rugs, tapestries, wallpaper, textiles, and entire interiors. The large, luxurious antique European carpets produced under his direction are luxurious and stunning in their integration of European and Oriental styles. Another designer in the Morris circle was C.F. Voisey who worked on carpets as well as textiles and wallpapers. The style spread to Donegal, Ireland, where Alexander Morton established a workshop around 1900 to weave carpets, often incorporating indigenous Celtic motives. American designers further spread the handmade, hand crafted look as the Mission style, particularly popular in the West. Arts and Crafts carpets are thick, rustic and usually employ allover patterns. The rich, heavy pile comes from local Irish sheep.

She is wearing nothing more than a headband, which parts the front section of her extremely life-like hair. Her facial characteristics also demonstrate the sculptors exceptional talents. With outstanding symmetry, her eyes are perfectly carved and in line with one another, while her nose and lips are of perfect proportions to a real person. A similar bust of Daphne can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, by the famous American female sculptor Harriet Goodhue Hosmer.
According to Greek mythology, Daphne was the sun God Apollo's first love. She was a nymph who did not want to engage in the constructs of marriage and respected the sanctity of virginity.

Robert Scott (13 November 1777–1841) was a Scottish engraver. The son of Grizell and Robert Scott, he was born on 13 November 1777 at Lanark, where his father was a skinner. He attended the grammar school at Musselburgh, and at the age of ten was articled to Andrew Robertson, an engraver at Edinburgh; there he also worked in the Trustees' Academy. Among his pupils were John Burnet, John Horsburgh, and James Stewart. He died early in 1841.
Scott first became known for some plates in James Anderson of Herminston's The Bee for 1793 and 1794, and a set of Views of Seats and Scenery chiefly in the Environs of Edinburgh, from drawings by Alexander Carse and Andrew Wilson, published in 1795 and 1796. He made the most of his abilities, and was known in his day for his small book illustrations; he carried on a manufactory in Parliament Stairs, Edinburgh, employing many assistants.

Scott's most significant work was in landscape. He engraved the illustrations to George Barry's History of the Orkney Islands, 1805, and to Scenery of Allan Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd, 1808; he also for many years contributed plates to the Scots Magazine, and put in the landscape backgrounds of some of those for John Bell's Poets of Great Britain.

He was employed by Henry Mozley, publisher at Gainsborough (the father of Thomas Mozley and James Bowling Mozley), for whose edition of James Thomson's The Seasons (1804), he engraved four plates after John Burnet. Scott's last work was a set of twenty views of ‘Scenery of Edinburgh and Midlothian,’ 1838, from drawings by his son, William Bell Scott. By his final years he had obtained a prestigious studio at 65 Princes Street and was living at 15 Lauriston Street in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh. Both buildings are now demolished."

This map depicts the northeast coast of the island of Juan Fernandez with Cumberland Bay, South America. 

In 1740 Anson set sail in command of a squadron sent to attack Spanish possessions and interests in South America. The expedition was ill-equipped and failed to carry out its original ambitious mission. By June 1741 when Anson reached Juan Fernandes, his force had been reduced to only three of the original six ships, while the strength of his crews had fallen from 961 to 335. After launching several attacks on the west coast of South America and recuperating on the island he collected the remaining survivors on his flagship, the Centurion, and set sail in search of one of the richly laden galleons that conducted the trade between Mexico and the Philippines. The indomitable perseverance he had shown during one of the most arduous voyages in the history of sea adventure gained the reward of the capture of an immensely rich prize, the Nuestra Señora de Covadonga, which he encountered off Cape Espiritu Santo on June 20, 1743. This map originates from 'Reize rondsom de Werreld (..)' by George Anson, published 1749.

The Juan Fernández Islands are a sparsely inhabited island group in the South Pacific Ocean reliant on tourism and fishing. Situated 670 km (362 nmi; 416 mi) off the coast of Chile, they are composed of three main volcanic islands: Robinson Crusoe, Alejandro Selkirk and Santa Clara. The group is part of Insular Chile.

The islands are primarily known for having been the home to the marooned sailor Alexander Selkirk for more than four years from 1704, which may have inspired Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. Most of the archipelago's present-day inhabitants reside on Robinson Crusoe Island, and mainly in the capital, San Juan Bautista, located at Cumberland Bay on the island's north coast.

The group of islands is part of Chile's Valparaíso Region (which also includes Easter Island) and, along with the Desventuradas Islands, forms one of the nine communes of Valparaíso Province. The islands are named after Juan Fernández, the explorer who discovered them in the 1570s.",0

It depicts the vast territories conquered by Alexander the Great during his reign, stretching from Greece across the Near East to parts of India.

This map is particularly interesting for its depiction of:

1. **Vast Empire**: It covers the extensive reach of Alexander's empire, highlighting the diverse regions he conquered, from Macedonia and Greece to Egypt, Persia, and beyond.

2. **Historical Context**: The map represents the Hellenistic world post-Alexander’s conquests, which led to the spread of Greek culture across the known world in a period known as the Hellenistic Age.

3. **Inset Maps**: There are inset maps of significant battle sites and cities, like Halicarnassus and Tyre, reflecting key moments in Alexander's military campaigns.

4. **Geographical Features**: The map shows important geographical landmarks, such as the Nile River, the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the mountain ranges that Alexander's army would have traversed.

5. **Latin Nomenclature**: The use of Latin titles and labels for places and geographic features reflects the academic traditions of the time when the map was created.

6. **Cultural Blending**: The map may illustrate the beginnings of the fusion between Greek and Eastern cultures that Alexander's conquests initiated.

7. **Strategic Routes**: It might depict strategic routes used in Alexander’s military campaigns, including the path to the Indus Valley.

This map is from the ""Spruner-Menke Atlas Antiquus,"" crafted by Karl Spruner von Merz and edited by Theodorus Menke. The atlas was a notable 19th-century publication used for educational purposes, offering detailed maps of ancient civilizations with a focus on historical accuracy.

The period the map covers corresponds to Alexander's campaigns, which lasted from 336 to 323 BC, a time when he created one of the largest empires in ancient history and greatly influenced the subsequent cultural and political landscape of these regions.",0

Made of copper with wooden handle. Marked with Merriman's trident logo.

The MERRIMAN Bros. Inc. was founded in 1898, and published catalogs of yacht hardware up until the 1960s; it offered for sale most of the well-known bronze fittings that you have seen on the decks and in the rigging of the finest sailboats.

The Merriman brothers, Edward B. and Franklin, were metallurgists with a keen interest in boats and sailing. In 1907 when the racing cutter 'AVENGER' was launched at the Herreshoff yard in Bristol, RI, she carried 37 new blocks designed by Nat Herreshoff and built by the Merriman brothers. Their yacht hardware business grew to include custom blocks made in their Jamaica Plain factory for RESOLUTE, and for countless other yachts large and small. Their main business was not blocks and winches, however; it was Merriman megaphones, including the familiar 
cheerleader megaphones. They had a patent for the Stentor Megaphone dated April 4, 1899, naming the rivets, metal mouthpiece, and adjacent parts in the patent. The Navy specified Merriman megaphones because of their scientifically proven horn angle of 22 degrees. The Penobscot Marine Museum has a Stentor Megaphone from 1900 in their collection.

The Herreshoff cutter, AVENGER, by the way, was “one of our greatest prize winners,” according to L. Francis Herreshoff in his book Introduction to Yachting, page 170-71. With many innovations for her time, such as hollow spars, and an overlapping jib, she won three successive Astor Cups in 1907, ’08, ’09, and again in 1911 when owned by Alexander S. Cochran. AVENGER was 74′9″ LOA, 53′ LWL,  and 14′6″ beam with a draft of 9′6″.

Merriman Bros. Inc. factory was located in Jamaica Plain, near Boston, Massachusetts, and subsequently moved to Hingham, Massachusetts. In 1963 Merriman Bros. Inc. became a subsidiary of UTD Corporation in Hingham. It ceased operations in 1967.","8"" x 5.5"" x 3"" (Width x Depth x Height)"

Adolf Metzner was an Indianapolis pharmacist and artist who served in the Civil War and moved to Hamilton, Ohio where he painted copies of Grutzner's whimsical depictions of monks in everyday life.

""Eduard Theodor Ritter von Grützner (1846 - 1925) Born into a land-owning family in Upper Silesia on May 26, 1846, he showed an early interest in painting and drawing and became well known for his figure and genre paintings, especially those of monks.

In 1864, with the help of an architect Hirschberg, he left home for art education at the private school of Herman Dyck in Munich.  In his first semester, he transferred to the Classical Art class of Johann Georg Hiltensperger and Alexander Ströhuber, where the students learned about the aesthetic ideals of antiquity.  In 1865, Grützner joined the painting class of Hermann Anschütz at the Munich Academy.  Meanwhile, he also sought advice and inspiration with Carl Theodor von Piloty  until he was taken into his class in 1867.   Piloty's class was packed with aspiring artists from around the world, from Hungary, Greece, Germany, Russia, and Poland.  After three years under Piloty, Grützner left the academy.

In 1870 he moved into his own studio in the garden house of Schwanthalerstraße 18 in Munich.  He quickly began to produce one painting after another.  He made his career in Munich and was very successful.  It was reported by artist and writer Friedrich Pecht in the journal Die Kunst für Alle (Art for All) in 1886: ""the painters Eduard Grützner and Ludwig Willroider were granted the title of ""professor"" by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria.  In 1880 he was awarded the Order of Merit of St. Michael (Knight's Cross) first class.  Eduard von Grützner was appointed professor at the Munich Academy in 1886.  He was knighted in 1916.

Grützner, along with Carl Spitzweg and Franz von Defregger, became one of Munich's leading genre painters in the second half of the 19th century.  The paintings Grützner is best known for combine detailed academic rendering with humorous and anecdotal subject matter, often depicting monks drinking.  Apart from his monastic pictures Grützner also produced a Falstaff-cycle, theater and hunting scenes and affectionately detailed interior studies, which he often included in his monastic scenes.  He also worked as a free-lance illustrator, caricaturist and graphic artist.

He was married twice and in his old age he sought solace in Chinese philosophy, and began to collect items from the far east and learned Japanese.  Occasionally he included a Buddha figure or a Chinese vase in some of his paintings.  He also painted a number of ascetic-looking cardinals, often with harsh and unsympathetic features.  He died on April 2, 1925 in Munich.""",":

Birdseye Maple 
occurs primarily in Sugar Maple and is a very hard wood with divergent grain structure caused by the presence of the Birdseyes.

In the days when all furniture was made essentially by hand, Birdseye Maple was used by only the most capable cabinetmakers. These artisans had developed the tools and skills to work and finish Birdseye Maple successfully. Antique furniture made out of Birdseye Maple is rare and beautiful.

The divergent grain that makes Birdseye Maple beautiful also makes it difficult to work. Early woodworking machines ran at low rpms and had only 2 knives per cutterhead. This often produced Birdseye surfaces that were chipped and torn. It took many hours of hand planing and scraping to get these surfaces to a high sheen.

This limited the use of Birdseye maple to projects whose value could justify the extra labour cost. Examples of this are fine furniture and musical instruments.

The Royal and Military Order of Saint Ferdinand (Spanish: Real y Militar Orden de San Fernando), commonly known as Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand (Spanish: Cruz Laureada de San Fernando), is Spain's highest military award for gallantry. The Order of Calatrava (Spanish: Orden de Calatrava Portuguese: Ordem de Calatrava) was the first military order founded in Castile, but the second to receive papal approval. The papal bull confirming the Order of Calatrava as a Militia was given by Pope Alexander III on September 26, 1164. The Order of Santiago (Galician: Orde de Santiago, Spanish: Orden de Santiago) was founded in the 12th century, and owes its name to the national patron of Galicia and Spain, Santiago (St. James the Greater), under whose banner the Christians of Galicia and Asturias began in the 9th century to combat and drive back the Muslims of the Iberian Peninsula.

The scene shows the sea otter resting on the shore, with a tranquil backdrop of water and the sky, capturing a moment from the late 18th-century explorations of Captain James Cook.

Description: This is a 1801 copperplate engraving from George Alexander Cooke's ""Universal Geography"" .

More info on its publication: The print is part of George Alexander Cooke's comprehensive work ""A Modern and Authentic System of Universal Geography."" This book was a significant compilation of geographical knowledge during the late 18th century, offering descriptions and accounts of various parts of the world, influenced by the age of exploration. It includes narratives of famed explorers like Captain James Cook and Ferdinand Magellan, detailing their discoveries and journeys that expanded the European understanding of the globe.

Together on a sheet with 'Cape Maccartney and Cape Gower'. 

The top two views depict coastal profile views of local islands named after important people in the Embassy, including Macartney, Staunton, and Gower. Below, a view of the city of Ten-Tchoo-Foo taken from aboard the Hindostan, one of the ships on the mission. These land approach views appeared in the account of George Macartney's travels to China, published by George Nicol. Macartney was Britain's first envoy to China, and was tasked with convincing Emperor Qianlong to ease restrictions on trade between Great Britain and China by allowing the British to have a permanent embassy in the country. Sir George Staunton prepared the official report, 'An Authentic Account of an Embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China', which included charts and views based on manuscript sketches and drawings by Sir John Barrow, the personal secretary of Macartney, as well as the artists William Alexander and Thomas Hickey.

From another source: Macartney was dispatched to Beijing in 1792, traveling via Madeira, Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro, the Cape of Good Hope and Indonesia. He was accompanied by Staunton, and a retinue of suitably impressive size, including Staunton's 11-year-old son who was nominally the ambassador's page. On the embassy's arrival in China it emerged that the 11-year-old was the only European member of the embassy able to speak Mandarin, and thus the only one able to converse with the Emperor. The embassy, the first such to China, had two objectives: the first to register with the Emperor, British displeasure at the treatment that the British merchants were receiving from the Chinese, the second to gain permission for a British minister to be resident in China. The first objective was achieved, the second was not. Macartney was twice granted an audience with the Emperor and in December 1793 he was sumptuously entertained by the Chinese viceroy in Canton, and returned to England via Macao and St. Helena, arriving in September 1794. This important text produced some of the earliest accurate maps of the interior of China and provided many invaluable geographical and cultural observations. This rare print depicts the Shantung Peninsula, and includes one harbor view and two elevations printed on one sheet. The top elevation depicts Cape Macartney and Staunton's Head from the north east, while the middle elevation shows Cape Macartney and Cape Gower from the north west. At the bottom is a view of the city of Ten-Tchoo-Foo from the ocean.

Longleat is an English stately home and the seat of the Marquesses of Bath. A leading and early example of the Elizabethan prodigy house, it is adjacent to the village of Horningsham and near the towns of Warminster and Westbury in Wiltshire and Frome in Somerset. It is noted for its Elizabethan country house, maze, landscaped parkland and safari park. The house is set in 1,000 acres (400 ha) of parkland landscaped by Capability Brown, with 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) of let farmland and 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) of woodland, which includes a Center Parcs holiday village. It was the first stately home to open to the public, and the Longleat estate includes the first safari park outside Africa.

The house was built by Sir John Thynne and was designed mainly by Robert Smythson, after Longleat Priory was destroyed by fire in 1567. It took 12 years to complete and is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of Elizabethan architecture in Britain. It continues to be the seat of the Thynn family, who have held the title of Marquess of Bath since 1789; the present Marquess, Ceawlin Thynn, took over management of the business from his father Alexander in 2010.

Astroblepus Grixalvii Humb. 2. Pimelodus Cyclopum Humb.' The fish depicted are indeed catfish, as suggested by the common name associated with the genus Pimelodus, which are a diverse group of benthic fishes known for their barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers.

The term ""Humb."" refers to Alexander von Humboldt, a Prussian naturalist and explorer whose work on biogeography is foundational in the field. The fish species named after him, such as Astroblepus Grixalvii and Pimelodus Cyclopum, would have been discovered during his expeditions, most famously his exploration of the Americas, including the Amazon River.

The engraving itself is indicative of the period's scientific illustrations, which were created to document and share new species' discoveries with the scientific community and the educated public. These illustrations were meticulously crafted, often by skilled artists who specialized in scientific drawings. They would have been published in natural history books or as separate plates, meant for a readership of scientists, hobbyists, and collectors interested in natural history.

The publication by Whittaker in 1824 places this work in the context of the early 19th century, a period of intense scientific discovery and exploration. ""Whittaker"" refers to a publishing house active in London during this time, known for publishing a wide range of works, including those on natural history.

As for the method, ""hand coloring"" indicates that the prints were individually colored by hand after the engraving process. This was a common practice before color printing technology became widespread, making each print slightly unique.

William Trotter was born into a family of merchants in 1772, descended on the maternal side from the family of John Knox. He became a member of The Merchant Company in 1797 and by 1809 he was sole proprietor of the firm Young & Trotter. Accounts from the firm survive for over fifty patrons including the marquesses of Graham and Tweeddale; the earls of Cassillis, Dumfries, Hopetoun, Lauderdale, Traquair and Panmure; the Lords Arniston, Hailes and Milton; the baronets James Clerk, William Forbes, John Hall and Alexander Kinloch; and the lairds of Ardwall, Balbirnie, Boqhan, Cairnfield, Drummelzior, Freswick, Kemnay, Kilbagie, Langton, Largo, Menziesfield, Moncraig, Newliston, Prestonhall, Saughton and Stair, as well as accounts for the Assembly Rooms, Holyroodhouse, and Register House. 

Often regarded as the most eminent of all Scottish cabinet makers, his success was in part due to his appreciation for his client's taste. Using the finest quality materials, Trotter developed a distinctive Regency style typically characterised by bold carving, bead moulding and reeded legs and supplied furnishings to some of Scotland's most important houses and institutions including: numerous apartments in the Palace of Holyroodhouse; Dumfries House; Mount Stuart and Edinburgh's Parliament House.

One of the plates from this set is featured in ""The Dictionary of Worcester Porcelain,"" Volume 1, 1751-1851, by John Sandon. (See color plate 76 on page 300). Sandon notes that the shell painting on this plate ""was probably by John Barker.""
BACKGROUND ON JOHN BARKER AT WORCESTER: According to ""The Dictionary of Worcester Porcelain,"" John Barker was a landscape painter who also excelled at painting shells. Flight's factory records him as such, although no signed pieces are known by John Barker.
However, Sandon writes in ""The Dictionary of Worcester Porcelain,"" ""There remains a large group of pieces (with shell painting) mostly from the Barr Flight and Barr period painted with shells seemingly by a single hand (see Colour Plates 76 and 77). The fine weed in the background of these compositions is grouped into tiny clumps of filaments in contrast to the more dendritic treatment of Samuel Smith. It is reasonable to conjecture that these pieces are the work of John Barker.""
The style of painting with this seaweed background matches that on our five plates.
BACKGROUND OF *FLIGHT BARR AND BARR WORCESTER: Flight Barr Barr Worcester were manufacturers to their Majesties. According to the Worcester Porcelain Museum, ""During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Chinese porcelain was a great status symbol. Worcester produced a magnificent alternative, whiter with brighter colors and more readily available, becoming the height of fashion in the early 19th century. The customer accounts of this period would read like a 'who's who' of the day. Rich personalized services were made for the wealthiest customers, including Tzar Alexander I, The Duke of York, King George III, King William IV, The Duke of Clarence, The Imam of Muscat, The Marquis of Buckingham, and the Nabob of Oude."""

Peter Behrens, 
(14 April 1868 – 27 February 1940) was a leading German architect, graphic and industrial designer, best known for his early pioneering AEG Turbine Hall in Berlin in 1909. He had a long career, designing objects, typefaces, and important buildings in a range of styles from the 1900s to the 1930s. He was a foundation member of the German Werkbund in 1907, when he also began designing for AEG, pioneered corporate design, graphic design, producing typefaces, objects, and buildings for the company. In the next few years, he became a successful architect, a leader of the rationalist / classical German Reform Movement of the 1910s. After WW1 he turned to Brick Expressionism, designing the remarkable Hoechst Administration Building outside Frankfurt, and from the mid-1920s increasingly to New Objectivity. He was also an educator, heading the architecture school at Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from 1922 to 1936. As a well known architect he produced design across Germany, in other European countries, Russia and England. Several of the leading names of European modernism worked for him when they were starting out in the 1910s, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius.
Behrens attended the Christianeum Hamburg from September 1877 until Easter 1882. He studied painting in his native Hamburg, as well as in Düsseldorf and Karlsruhe, from 1886 to 1889. In 1890, he married Lilly Kramer and moved to Munich. At first, he worked as a painter, illustrator and bookbinder in an artisanal fashion. He frequented the bohemian circles and was interested in subjects related to the reform of lifestyles. In 1899 Behrens accepted the invitation of the Grand Duke Ernst-Ludwig of Hesse to be the second member of his recently inaugurated Darmstadt Artists' Colony, where Behrens built his own Jugendstil style house in 1901, and fully conceived everything, from furniture to towels, paintings, pottery, etc. The building of this house is considered to be the turning point in his life, when he left the artistic circles of Munich and showed himself to be a talented architect in his very first project.

In 1903, Behrens was named director of the Kunstgewerbeschule in Düsseldorf, where he implemented successful reforms, developing new ways of teaching design.[1] In 1907, Behrens and ten other people (Hermann Muthesius, Theodor Fischer, Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Bruno Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, Fritz Schumacher, among others), plus twelve companies, gathered to create the German Werkbund. As an organization, it was clearly indebted to the principles and priorities of the Arts and Crafts movement, but tending towards the classical in architecture. Members of the Werkbund were focused on improving the overall level of taste in Germany by improving the design of everyday objects and products. This very practical aspect made it an extremely influential organization among industrialists, public policy experts, designers, investors, critics and academics. His work in the early 1900s included a series of exhibition halls and pavilions, a crematorium and some private houses, which show a new direction immediately after his own Jugendstil house, towards exploring simple, rectilinear volumes and classical sources.[2]


AEG Turbine Factory, 1908–1909, in the Moabit district of Berlin. An early example of industrial classicism.
In 1907, AEG (Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft) retained Behrens as artistic consultant, and his work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives. He designed the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) and for that he is considered the first industrial designer in history. He also designed a series of factory buildings for them at their two Berlin factory sites, most famously the 1909 AEG Turbine Factory, at the Moabit site, considered an early example of Modernism. He then went on to design four new buildings at the Humboldthain site, which showed that he was as much interested in massive, bold, classical and picturesque effects depending on the context, as expressing modernity. Since Peter Behrens was a consultant rather than an employee of AEG, he was free to work on other projects, and developed a highly successful architectural practice. In this period his growing office had many students and assistants, some who would go on become leading Modernists, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, Adolf Meyer, Jean Kramer and Walter Gropius (later to become the first director of the Bauhaus).
Immediately after the AEG Turbine Hall, he designed a series of large office buildings in a bold monumental stripped classical form, part of the German Reform Architecture movement. His 1912 German Embassy in St Petersburg, and the Administration Building for Continental AG in Hannover, built 1912–1914 are good examples of this period.
After WW1 his work changed again, and like many German architects, he explored the themes and styles of Brick Expressionism. Between 1920 and 1924, he was responsible for the design and construction of the Technical Administration Building of Hoechst AG in Höchst, outside Frankfurt. With its soaring atrium clad in colored bricks representing the factory’s dye products, and an exterior in dark clinker bricks with clocktower and dramatic arch, it is one of the most representative examples of the style in Germany.
Atrium, Hoechst, Frankfurt, 1924
In 1922, he accepted an invitation to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, becoming head of the architecture school, a post he kept until 1936, whilst also designing for a range of clients across Europe.
In 1926, Behrens was commissioned by the Englishman Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke to design a family home in Northampton, UK. The house named 'New Ways', a stark white walled rectangular volume (with jagged parapets), is often regarded as probably the first modernist house in Britain, and marks Behrens' turn towards the Modernism of New Objectivity.
In 1925 he was invited by his former student Mies van der Rohe, along with many of the leading German architects working in the new style, to design a residential building in Stuttgart, in the development now known as the Weissenhof. His contribution was a set of apartments in stacked cubic volumes, allowing many apartments to open to large terraces.
In 1928 Behrens won an international competition for the construction of the New Synagogue, in Zilina, Slovakia, which was restored in 2012–17 as a cultural centre. The same year he designed a renovation of the Feller-Stern department store in central Zagreb, Croatia, transforming it from Art Nouveau to a complex almost De Stijl Modernist composition. His 1931 hillside villa for the Clara Gans, daughter of Frankfurt industrialist Adolf Gans, was a similarly complex interplay of rectangular volumes, clad in stone, a fine example of New Objectivity.
In 1929, Behrens was invited to the competition for the design of buildings around a proposed radical redesign of Alexanderplatz in Berlin, and though he came second, his designs for the buildings on the south west side of the new square was preferred by the subsequent developer,[6] and the Alexanderhaus and the Berolinahaus were built by 1932.
In 1929, Behrens, in partnership with former student Alexander Popp, was commissioned to design a new factory for the state-run Austria Tabak in Linz, which was built over a long period, due to the economic conditions, finally completed in 1935. The main building has a very long completely horizontal slightly curved facade, Behrens’ most striking design in the style of New Objectivity.
In 1936 Behrens left Vienna to teach architecture at the Prussian Academy of Arts (now the Akademie der Künste) in Berlin, reportedly with the specific approval of Hitler. Behrens participated in Hitler's plans for the rebuilding of Berlin with the commission for the new headquarters of the AEG on Albert Speer's famous planned north–south axis. Speer reported that his selection of Behrens for this commission was rejected by the powerful Alfred Rosenberg, but that his decision was supported by Hitler who admired Behrens's Saint Petersburg Embassy. Behrens died in the Hotel Bristol in Berlin on 27 February 1940, while seeking refuge there from his country estate.

Why are there so many antiques in Argentina?
In the 1880 – 1940 there was a grate wave of immigration encouraged by the periods of war that were taking place.
1st World War took place between 1914 and 1918
2nd World War took place between 1939 and 1945
 The immigrants options were New York or Buenos Aires. Tickets were cheap and in Buenos Aires they were welcomed with open arms, as it was a country where everything was still to be done.
Argentina was the country of new opportunities, labour was needed and religious freedom was assured, in many cases the of the family travel first until they were settled and then the rest of the family members join them.
In the immigrant museum “Ellis Island Immigrant Building” in New York you can se the promotional posters of the boats that would take them to a new life.
Between the years 1895 and 1896, Argentina had the highest DGP (gross domestic product) per capita in the world according to the Maddison Historical Statistics index, this situation arose due to the large amount of food being exported to European countries, which were at war.
The Argentinean ships left the port of Buenos Aires with food, but they returned with furniture, clothes and construction elements, (it´s common to see this the old buildings of the historic neighbourhood of San Telmo, the beams with the inscription “Made in England)”, as well as many markets that were built in Buenos Aires, such us the San Telmo Market, whose structure was brought by ship and afterwards assembled in 900 Defensa Street. 
With the great influence of European immigrants living in the country, the children of the upper classes travelled to study in France, resulting in the inauguration of “La Maison Argentinienne”, on 27th of June 1928, in the international city of Paris, which hosted many Argentinians that were studying in Frace. 
It´s the fourth house to be built after France, Canada and Belgium, being the first Spanish-speaking one. Still in place today (17 Bd Jourdan, 75014, Paris, France). Many of the children of these wealthy families who attended international art exhibitions, museums and art courses abroad, took a keen interest in the European style. This is why Buenos Aires was at the time referred as “The Paris of South America”.
Between the years 1890 and 1920 more than a hundred Palaces were built on Alvear Avenue the most exclusive avenue in Buenos Aires. Today some of these palaces have been transformed into museums, hotels and embassies.
In the year 1936, the Kavanagh building was inaugurated, it was the tallest reinforced concrete building in South America.
During 1994 the American Society of Civil Engineers distinguished it as an “international engineering milestone”, and it´s now considered a World Heritage of Modern Architecture.
At the time was common to hire foreign architects such as Le Corbusier, who visited Buenos Aires/Argentina in 1929 and in 1948 he drew up the blueprints for a house built in La Plata City (which was declared a World Heritage Site).
In 1947, the Hungarian architect Marcelo Breuer designed “Parador Ariston” in the seaside city of Mar del Plata. After an Argentinean student at Harvard University convinced him to come to Argentina. He worked on an urban development project in the Casa Amarilla, area of La Boca. 
The Ukrainian architect, Vladimiro Acosta, arrives in Argentina in 1928 and worked as an architect until que moved to Brazil.
Antonio Bonet, a Spanish architect who worked with Le Corbusier in Paris, arrives in Argentina in 1937, where he carried out several architectural works and in 1938 designs the well-known BFK chair.
Andres Kálnay, of Hungarian origin, made around 120 architectural masterpieces, among which the former Munich brewery stands out, he even made the furniture’s design. 
The German architect, Walter Gropius, director of the Bauhaus, lived in Argentina, where he wrote articles for “Sur” magazine and founded in Buenos Aires, an architectural firm with Franz Möller, who was also an architect, where he built two houses.
At the same time several famous designers decided to immigrate to Argentina, among them we can find the well-known French designer, Jean-Michel Frank, who arrived in the country in 1940 and also worked for the Rockefeller family.
Special pieces were made, which were sold exclusively in the country, such as the well-known German company “WMF”, who sold their products by catalogue, which were chosen by the ladies of high society in the list of wedding gifts, as well as the pieces designed by Christofle. 
The Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, made special pieces for Argentinean mansions.
In 1904 the first Jansen branch outside Paris was established in Buenos Aires, as the Argentinean clientele demanded a large amount of furniture, from the end of the 19th century to the Mid-20th Century.
In 1970, the brand Rigolleau Argentina made pieces authorised by Lalique.
The brands Maple and Thompson also set up shop in the country.
The French plastic artist, Marcel Duchamp moved to Argentina in 1918-1919.
Glass signed Gallé, Charder, Leverre, Schneider, Muller and other French firms. They were bought in flower shops and were given to ladies with beautiful floral arrangements.
 Some furniture manufacturers travelled to international fairs and bough the patterns to produce the furniture in Argentina, such as the furniture firm Englander and Bonta, who bought the patterns in Italy.
It is worth mentioning that in Argentina we have the largest community of Italians outside of Italy, as it is estimated that 70 percent of the inhabitants have at least one Italian descendant, followed by Spanish immigrants.
The most Important furniture stores in Argentina:
Comte is founded in 1934 (under the direct management of Jean Michel Frank in 1940).
Nordiska (Swedish company established in 1934).
Churba in 1960, a company that brought foreign designers to present their furniture in the country:

Plata Lappas (Lappas Silver): a goldsmith shop founded in 1887 in Argentina by Alcibiades Lappas of Greek origin.
In 2019, in Argentina took place “the Art Deco world congress”, in which we participated as hosts invited by Geo Darder, founder of the Copperbridge – Foundation, in which prominent people from all over the world attended to learn about Art Deco in Argentina.
Argentina currently has more than 100 Art Deco buildings and another 90 Art Nouveau buildings throughout the city of Buenos Aires.
Argentina is a country that has not been involved in many wars, which is why it has been a refuge for works of art and antiques from different periods of time, unlike European countries. That is way many collectors, museums and antique dealers from all over the world visit it, you should not miss the opportunity to visit this great country.

TRASFORMATIO
Design Non Convenzionale
TRASFORMATIO is a design line born from the collaboration between the artist Michele Iodice and the Esprit Nouveau Gallery in Naples.
Alberta Saladino, founder and soul of Esprit Nouveau Gallery, has been proactively involved in ‘900 antique pieces research during the last twenty years and invited Michele Iodice to think of a way to reinterpret some Art Deco complementary design and furnishing pieces, from her private collection.
TRASFORMATIO project has a pioneer and artistic soul able to set the connection lines between past, present and future.
The whole idea was born with the aim to explore interactions between art and design.
TRASFORMATIO traces an historical path in human minds, that starts with the birth of design and reaches our living present, embracing artistic novelties with wisdom.
The common thread of the exhibition is dynamism.
“Most of the people think a furnishing piece can only be a set of elements that move in the emptiness of space. Nevertheless, for others it can be poetry”.
Alexander Calder described his most successful pieces of work with the above words.
Michele Iodice, fully interprets his thought through TRASFORMATIO. His art works are fluctuating in a dynamic equilibrium where they are able to break the physical limits of traditional static furniture, attributing them movement and lightness.
TRASFORMATIO artistic methods can be applied to every kind of support.
It does not reproduce, but it tears the item out of its traditional context to revive it, instead, in a completely different and new environment.
The setup personally curated by the Neapolitan artist, combines a collection of pieces that express the close relationship between design and contemporary art, as well as the strong connection between cultural stratification and innovation.
Every object signed by Michele Iodice is rigorously realized by local artisans and tells about the attention to detail behind it, in a process that enhances the principles and values of “artigianato cosciente”, in English, “conscious craftsmanship”.
The materials used spans from wood, parchment, and Plexiglas, to steel, combined in a fusion that is aimed to reflect the complexity of the research that Iodice has been performing since years.",0

With a beautiful geometric design cased underneath the top blue layer, which protrudes the design underneath the top blue layer of glass.   The bottom layer is white which truly differentiates the light blue upper layer.  Both pieces of glass are mounted on an ormolu hinge which holds the top and bottom pieces of glass comfortably together.  Glass boxes such as this one are very rare to find in this quality, condition, and size as they are very difficult to hand make and finish. The ormolu mount is all hand-chased and hand-chiseled with the best quality.  The prismic geometric pattern is something very unusual and a timeless design.

Caldwell Pair of Silvered and Doré Bronze Neoclassic Lamps,"https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/9195/13/XXX_9195_1343687436_1.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/9195/13/9195_1343687436_1.jpg",52500.0,"Furniture >Lighting >Floor Lamps ,Furniture,Lighting,Floor Lamps,","Caldwell, a pair of doré and silvered bronze tripod form floor lamps on conforming marble bases. The seven-armed candelabra are carried on neoclassic urns decorated with rams' heads and laurel wreath swags.

Caldwell and Co. were America's greatest designers and manufacturers of decorative metal items and lighting. Founded in 1895 by Edward F. Caldwell and Victor von Lossberg, the firm would go on to do homes for the Gilded Age's greatest oligarchs, including various Vanderbilts, Morgans and Fricks. The Harvard Club, the Flatiron Building and Rockefeller Center are a small part of their legacy.

There are so many projects in America and abroad that they are far too numerous to mention. However they all have one thing in common, an absolute dedication to producing the finest works of art. 

The company's designers drew on centuries of European and Oriental design traditions combining motifs from the 15th century with others selected from the 16th through 20th centuries. Their early championing of the Art Deco style allowed them to become the pre-eminent designers and craftsmen working in this style. One only has to visit Rockefeller center to see their supreme mastery of this style. 

Their staff of designers and craftsmen made objects finer than had been created since the Renaissance, when bronze makers like Michaelangelo, Donatello and DaVinci set the standards very high. 

The chasers, chasers and gilders reached back in time to rediscover lost techniques, and improved existing ones, like the lost wax method. This allowed the artisans to recreate the finest imaginations of the artist's mind, to rise from the void and be made real to the astonishment of the beholder.

Their techniques were so highly developed, they could probably have cast the breath of God if the opportunity had arisen. 

Our lamps are great examples of Caldwell's ability to bend molten bronze to their will, and we are all the better for it.

To remind, the lamps are 65 x 15 and have been recently rewired.",0

Peter Behrens, 
(14 April 1868 – 27 February 1940) was a leading German architect, graphic and industrial designer, best known for his early pioneering AEG Turbine Hall in Berlin in 1909. He had a long career, designing objects, typefaces, and important buildings in a range of styles from the 1900s to the 1930s. He was a foundation member of the German Werkbund in 1907, when he also began designing for AEG, pioneered corporate design,graphic design, producing typefaces, objects, and buildings for the company. In the next few years, he became a successful architect, a leader of the rationalist / classical German Reform Movement of the 1910s. After WW1 he turned to Brick Expressionism, designing the remarkable Hoechst Administration Building outside Frankfurt, and from the mid 1920s increasingly to New Objectivity. He was also an educator, heading the architecture school at Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from 1922 to 1936. As a well known architect he produced design across Germany, in other European countries, Russia and England. Several of the leading names of European modernism worked for him when they were starting out in the 1910s, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius.
Behrens attended the Christianeum Hamburg from September 1877 until Easter 1882. He studied painting in his native Hamburg, as well as in Düsseldorf and Karlsruhe, from 1886 to 1889. In 1890, he married Lilly Kramer and moved to Munich. At first, he worked as a painter, illustrator and bookbinder in an artisanal fashion. He frequented the bohemian circles and was interested in subjects related to the reform of lifestyles. In 1899 Behrens accepted the invitation of the Grand Duke Ernst-Ludwig of Hesse to be the second member of his recently inaugurated Darmstadt Artists' Colony, where Behrens built his own Jugendstil style house in 1901, and fully conceived everything, from furniture to towels, paintings, pottery, etc. The building of this house is considered to be the turning point in his life, when he left the artistic circles of Munich and showed himself to be a talented architect in his very first project.
In 1903, Behrens was named director of the Kunstgewerbeschule in Düsseldorf, where he implemented successful reforms, developing new ways of teaching design.[1] In 1907, Behrens and ten other people (Hermann Muthesius, Theodor Fischer, Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Bruno Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, Fritz Schumacher, among others), plus twelve companies, gathered to create the German Werkbund. As an organization, it was clearly indebted to the principles and priorities of the Arts and Crafts movement, but tending towards the classical in architecture. Members of the Werkbund were focused on improving the overall level of taste in Germany by improving the design of everyday objects and products. This very practical aspect made it an extremely influential organization among industrialists, public policy experts, designers, investors, critics and academics. His work in the early 1900s included a series of exhibition halls and pavilions, a crematorium and some private houses, which show a new direction immediately after his own Jugendstil house, towards exploring simple, rectilinear volumes and classical sources.[2]
AEG Turbine Factory, 1908–1909, in the Moabit district of Berlin. An early example of industrial classicism.
In 1907, AEG (Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft) retained Behrens as artistic consultant, and his work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives. He designed the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) and for that he is considered the first industrial designer in history. He also designed a series of factory buildings for them at their two Berlin factory sites, most famously the 1909 AEG Turbine Factory, at the Moabit site, considered an early example of Modernism. He then went on to design four new buildings at the Humboldthain site, which showed that he was as much interested in massive, bold, classical and picturesque effects depending on the context, as expressing modernity. Since Peter Behrens was a consultant rather than an employee of AEG, he was free to work on other projects, and developed a highly successful architectural practice. In this period his growing office had many students and assistants, some who would go on become leading Modernists, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,[3] Le Corbusier, Adolf Meyer, Jean Kramer and Walter Gropius (later to become the first director of the Bauhaus).
Immediately after the AEG Turbine Hall, he designed a series of large office buildings in a bold monumental stripped classical form, part of the German Reform Architecture movement. His 1912 German Embassy in St Petersburg, and the Administration Building for Continental AG in Hannover, built 1912–1914 are good examples of this period.
After WW1 his work changed again, and like many German architects, he explored the themes and styles of Brick Expressionism. Between 1920 and 1924, he was responsible for the design and construction of the Technical Administration Building of Hoechst AG in Höchst, outside Frankfurt. With its soaring atrium clad in coloured bricks representing the factory’s dye products, and an exterior in dark clinker bricks with clocktower and dramatic arch, it is one of the most representative examples of the style in Germany.
Atrium, Hoechst, Frankfurt, 1924
In 1922, he accepted an invitation to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, becoming head of the architecture school, a post he kept until 1936, whilst also designing for a range of clients across Europe.
In 1926, Behrens was commissioned by the Englishman Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke to design a family home in Northampton, UK. The house named 'New Ways', a stark white walled rectangular volume (with jagged parapets), is often regarded as probably the first modernist house in Britain,[4] and marks Behrens' turn towards the Modernism of New Objectivity.
In 1925 he was invited by his former student Mies van der Rohe, along with many of the leading German architects working in the new style, to design a residential building in Stuttgart, in the development now known as the Weissenhof. His contribution was a set of apartments in stacked cubic volumes, allowing many apartments to open to large terraces.
In 1928 Behrens won an international competition for the construction of the New Synagogue, in Zilina, Slovakia, which was restored in 2012–17 as a cultural centre. The same year he designed a renovation of the Feller-Stern department store in central Zagreb, Croatia, transforming it from Art Nouveau to a complex almost De Stijl Modernist composition. His 1931 hillside villa for the Clara Gans, daughter of Frankfurt industrialist Adolf Gans, was a similarly complex interplay of rectangular volumes, clad in stone, a fine example of New Objectivity.
In 1929, Behrens was invited to the competition for the design of buildings around a proposed radical redesign of Alexanderplatz in Berlin, and though he came second, his designs for the buildings on the south west side of the new square was preferred by the subsequent developer, and the Alexanderhaus and the Berolinahaus were built by 1932.

In 1929, Behrens, in partnership with former student Alexander Popp, was commissioned to design a new factory for the state-run Austria Tabak in Linz, which was built over a long period, due to the economic conditions, finally completed in 1935. The main building has a very long completely horizontal slightly curved facade, Behrens’ most striking design in the style of New Objectivity.
In 1936 Behrens left Vienna to teach architecture at the Prussian Academy of Arts (now the Akademie der Künste) in Berlin, reportedly with the specific approval of Hitler. Behrens participated in Hitler's plans for the rebuilding of Berlin with the commission for the new headquarters of the AEG on Albert Speer's famous planned north–south axis. Speer reported that his selection of Behrens for this commission was rejected by the powerful Alfred Rosenberg, but that his decision was supported by Hitler who admired Behrens's Saint Petersburg Embassy. Behrens died in the Hotel Bristol in Berlin on 27 February 1940, while seeking refuge there from his country estate.

Why are there so many antiques in Argentina?
In the 1880 – 1940 there was a grate wave of immigration encouraged by the periods of war that were taking place.
1st World War took place between 1914 and 1918
2nd World War took place between 1939 and 1945
 The immigrants options were New York or Buenos Aires. Tickets were cheap and in Buenos Aires they were welcomed with open arms, as it was a country where everything was still to be done.
Argentina was the country of new opportunities, labour was needed and religious freedom was assured, in many cases the of the family travel first until they were settled and then the rest of the family members join them.
In the immigrant museum “Ellis Island Immigrant Building” in New York you can se the promotional posters of the boats that would take them to a new life.
Between the years 1895 and 1896, Argentina had the highest DGP (gross domestic product) per capita in the world according to the Maddison Historical Statistics index, this situation arose due to the large amount of food being exported to European countries, which were at war.
The Argentinean ships left the port of Buenos Aires with food, but they returned with furniture, clothes and construction elements, (it´s common to see this the old buildings of the historic neighbourhood of San Telmo, the beams with the inscription “Made in England)”, as well as many markets that were built in Buenos Aires, such us the San Telmo Market, whose structure was brought by ship and afterwards assembled in 900 Defensa Street. 
With the great influence of European immigrants living in the country, the children of the upper classes travelled to study in France, resulting in the inauguration of “La Maison Argentinienne”, on 27th of June 1928, in the international city of Paris, which hosted many Argentinians that were studying in Frace. 
It´s the fourth house to be built after France, Canada and Belgium, being the first Spanish-speaking one. Still in place today (17 Bd Jourdan, 75014, Paris, France). Many of the children of these wealthy families who attended international art exhibitions, museums and art courses abroad, took a keen interest in the European style. This is why Buenos Aires was at the time referred as “The Paris of South America”.
Between the years 1890 and 1920 more than a hundred Palaces were built on Alvear Avenue the most exclusive avenue in Buenos Aires. Today some of these palaces have been transformed into museums, hotels and embassies.
In the year 1936, the Kavanagh building was inaugurated, it was the tallest reinforced concrete building in South America.
During 1994 the American Society of Civil Engineers distinguished it as an “international engineering milestone”, and it´s now considered a World Heritage of Modern Architecture.
At the time was common to hire foreign architects such as Le Corbusier, who visited Buenos Aires/Argentina in 1929 and in 1948 he drew up the blueprints for a house built in La Plata City (which was declared a World Heritage Site).
In 1947, the Hungarian architect Marcelo Breuer designed “Parador Ariston” in the seaside city of Mar del Plata. After an Argentinean student at Harvard University convinced him to come to Argentina. He worked on an urban development project in the Casa Amarilla, area of La Boca. 
The Ukrainian architect, Vladimiro Acosta, arrives in Argentina in 1928 and worked as an architect until que moved to Brazil.
Antonio Bonet, a Spanish architect who worked with Le Corbusier in Paris, arrives in Argentina in 1937, where he carried out several architectural works and in 1938 designs the well-known BFK chair.
Andres Kálnay, of Hungarian origin, made around 120 architectural masterpieces, among which the former Munich brewery stands out, he even made the furniture’s design. 
The German architect, Walter Gropius, director of the Bauhaus, lived in Argentina, where he wrote articles for “Sur” magazine and founded in Buenos Aires, an architectural firm with Franz Möller, who was also an architect, where he built two houses.
At the same time several famous designers decided to immigrate to Argentina, among them we can find the well-known French designer, Jean-Michel Frank, who arrived in the country in 1940 and also worked for the Rockefeller family.
Special pieces were made, which were sold exclusively in the country, such as the well-known German company “WMF”, who sold their products by catalogue, which were chosen by the ladies of high society in the list of wedding gifts, as well as the pieces designed by Christofle. 
The Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, made special pieces for Argentinean mansions.
In 1904 the first Jansen branch outside Paris was established in Buenos Aires, as the Argentinean clientele demanded a large amount of furniture, from the end of the 19th century to the mid-20th century.
In 1970, the brand Rigolleau Argentina made pieces authorised by Lalique.
The brands Maple and Thompson also set up shop in the country.
The French plastic artist, Marcel Duchamp moved to Argentina in 1918-1919.
Glass signed Gallé, Charder, Leverre, Schneider, Muller and other French firms. They were bought in flower shops and were given to ladies with beautiful floral arrangements.
 Some furniture manufacturers travelled to international fairs and bough the patterns to produce the furniture in Argentina, such as the furniture firm Englander and Bonta, who bought the patterns ins Italy.
It is worth mentioning that in Argentina we have the largest community of Italians outside of Italy, as it is estimated that 70 percent of the inhabitants have at least one Italian descendant, followed by Spanish immigrants.
The most Important furniture stores in Argentina:
Comte is founded in 1934 (under the direct management of Jean Michel Frank in 1940).
Nordiska (Swedish company established in 1934).
Churba in 1960, a company that brought foreign designers to present their furniture in the country:
Denmark: (Arne Jacobsen, Finn Juhl, Bender Madsen, Ejner Larsen, Poul Kjaerholm, Hans Wegner)
Sweden: (Hans Agne Jakobsson, Gustavsberg)
United States: (Herman Miller)
Finland: (Lisa Johansson, Folke Arstrom, Tapio Wirkkala, Alvar Aalto, Timo Sarpaneva)
Swedish Factory: (Orrefors)
Italy: (Littala, Vico Magistretti, Emma Gismondi, Gae Aulenti, Angelo Mangiarotti, Elio Martinelli, Gianna Celada, Angelo Mangiarotti, Mario Bellini, Carlo Scarpa)
Finland: (Olivia Toikka)
Plata Lappas (Lappas Silver): a goldsmith shop founded in 1887 in Argentina by Alcibiades Lappas of Greek origin.
In 2019, in Argentina took place “the Art Deco world congress”, in which we participated as hosts invited by Geo Darder, founder of the Copperbridge – Foundation, in which prominent people from all over the world attended to learn about Art Deco in Argentina.
Argentina currently has more than 100 Art Deco buildings and another 90 Art Nouveau buildings throughout the city of Buenos Aires.
Argentina is a country that has not been involved in many wars, which is why it has been a refuge for works of art and antiques from different periods of time, unlike European countries. That is way many collectors, museums and antique dealers from all over the world visit it, you should not miss the opportunity to visit this great country.

Stuart captures the swirling movement and material quality of the fog, which obscures the towering mountains adding an element of mystery and magic to the painting. In juxtaposition, the foreground of the painting is rendered in precise detail from the rippling tides to the leaves of grass. Each stag is differentiated adding an element of naturalism.

This exceptional antique sterling silver three piece tea service consists of a teapot, cream jug and sugar bowl.

Each piece has an oval rounded compressed form on to a collet base and four bracket style feet.

The body of each piece is embellished with chased flower and foliate decoration incorporating a shaped cartouche to either side, each displaying a contemporary bright cut engraved crest of a mower with his scythe proper habited*.

The upper rim of each piece is encompassed with a gadroon decorated border.

The swept shoulders and the swan necked spout of the teapot are further ornamented with chased floral and scrolling leaf decoration.

The original hinged hallmarked cover of the teapot is surmounted with a silver flower and leaf decorated finial.

The teapot is fitted with a C scroll sterling silver handle ornamented with an impressive leaf design incorporated into a scrolling thumbpiece.

The cream jug and sugar bowl have leaf decorated sterling silver C scroll handles and retain the original gilt interiors.

Each piece is supported by four impressive bracket style feet accented with floral and paw ornamentation in the classic Regency style.

The components of this exceptional antique teaware set were crafted by the renowned London silversmith Charles Thomas Fox.

* The crest pertains to the Pilkington family, who are found in the Counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire, although other families bearing the name are found further afield and a similar crest. Whether these families are genealogically connected is not known. The Pilkingtons, of Rivington in the County of Lancashire are probably the more ancient and senior line. Legend has it that a member of the family (which was said to be one of repute prior to the Norman Conquest of 1066) disguised himself when sought by Norman soldiers as a mower and escaped. A similar legend adheres to another Lancashire family, the De Traffords or Traffords in which a member of that family avoided capture by the Parliamentarians during the Civil War of the 17th Century by disguising himself as simple-minded thresher wielding a frail rather than the Pilkington's scythe.

There is certainly a possibility that this tea service was in the possession the baronetcy family of Pilkington, of Stanley in the County of Yorkshire who descended from Sir Alexander de Pilkington who held lands at Rivington during the reign of King Henry III. The baronet at the time of the manufacture of this tea service was Sir William Pilkington, the 8th Baronet (baptised 14th November 1775 died 30th 1850).

Condition
The pieces of this antique tea service are an exceptional gauge of silver, exceptional quality and in exceptional condition. Full hallmarks struck to the underside of the teapot and surface of the cream jug and sugar bowl, in addition to the part hallmarks to the interior of the teapot cover are very clear; the hallmarks are struck deeply due to the exceptional gauge of silver.
Reflections in photographs may detract from the true representation of these examples of antique silverware.","Teapot

Cloisonné enameled with meticulous care, the jardinière showcases playful foo dogs engaging with large, colorful egg-shaped balls and pale blue and lavender ribbons, all set against an elegant golden background. The foo dogs, with their lively presence, add a whimsical touch to the composition. The golden backdrop is adorned with stylized and understated gold star-flowers, creating a harmonious visual symphony.

The upper lip and rim around the base of this jardinière are gilt bronze, with delicate stylized floral motifs in lavender and turquoise adorning the inner frames of these rims, exhibiting repeating highly decorated patterns.

The jardinière boasts hand-crafted gilt bronze lion-mask handles with loose gold rings playfully held in their grinning mouths. The lions, with their stylized and curly manes, add a regal charm to the piece.

This jardinière is not only strikingly beautiful but also impressively large and exceptionally well-crafted. The high level of detail, along with the vibrant and carefully applied enamel work, speaks to the skill and artistry of the craftsmen of the era. As a noteworthy representation of Chinese cloisonné art during the Republic period, this jardinière is a fusion of tradition and creativity in a work of enduring beauty.",0

TRASFORMATIO
Design Non Convenzionale
TRASFORMATIO is a design line born from the collaboration between the artist Michele Iodice and the Esprit Nouveau Gallery in Naples.
Alberta Saladino, founder and soul of Esprit Nouveau Gallery, has been proactively involved in ‘900 antique pieces research during the last twenty years and invited Michele Iodice to think of a way to reinterpret some Art Deco complementary design and furnishing pieces, from her private collection.
TRASFORMATIO project has a pioneer and artistic soul able to set the connection lines between past, present and future.
The whole idea was born with the aim to explore interactions between art and design.
TRASFORMATIO traces an historical path in human minds, that starts with the birth of design and reaches our living present, embracing artistic novelties with wisdom.
The common thread of the exhibition is dynamism.
“Most of the people think a furnishing piece can only be a set of elements that move in the emptiness of space. Nevertheless, for others it can be poetry”.
Alexander Calder described his most successful pieces of work with the above words.
Michele Iodice, fully interprets his thought through TRASFORMATIO. His art works are fluctuating in a dynamic equilibrium where they are able to break the physical limits of traditional static furniture, attributing them movement and lightness.
TRASFORMATIO artistic methods can be applied to every kind of support.
It does not reproduce, but it tears the item out of its traditional context to revive it, instead, in a completely different and new environment.
The setup personally curated by the Neapolitan artist, combines a collection of pieces that express the close relationship between design and contemporary art, as well as the strong connection between cultural stratification and innovation.
Every object signed by Michele Iodice is rigorously realized by local artisans and tells about the attention to detail behind it, in a process that enhances the principles and values of “artigianato cosciente”, in English, “conscious craftsmanship”.
The materials used spans from wood, parchment, and Plexiglas, to steel, combined in a fusion that is aimed to reflect the complexity of the research that Iodice has been performing since years.",0

From our Jewellery Box collection, we are pleased to offer this Victorian Coromandel Jewellery Box. The box of rectangle shape with a domed top veneered in exotic Coromandel with brass strapping to the outside. Each brass mount is engraved with an abstract Greek key style design and is shaped into flower heads at each end. The centre brass mount on the lid has a vacant initial plaque. When opened the box reveals the silver cushioned velvet lining with black silk water paper on a lift out tray. The rear of the box bears the makers plaque which reads Edwards & Jones 161 Regent St. London. The Jewellery Box dates to the late Victorian period circa 1880.

The box comes with a working lock and key.

Coromandel is a valuable wood found in India, Sri Lanka and South East Asia. It has a contrasting hazel-brown colour with black grain. It is a dense, heavy wood that is so popular it has been logged to extinction over the last few hundred years. This makes Calamander pieces even more special.

Edwards & Jones were known Stationers and Dressing Case Makers from London. They began their partnership around 1865 when Edwards Henry Edwards and Alexander Jones joined forces in business. The business ran for around 30 years until it came to its demise in 1895.  It is believed that Edwards was formerly in business on his own as the Westminster Rates books show him trading on the west side of Regent Street in 1856. They are often listed in the directories under the headings of Dressing Case and Dressing Bag makers as well as Stationers. In 1880 they opened a second shop which was located in close proximity to their other store. At this address, they had an Ivory Warehouse and shared the building with Duvelleroy Jules, a fan manufacturer.

When the company closed in 1865 probably due to Jones retiring or possibly passing away, the company was renamed Edwards & Sons. Edward Edwards had 4 sons and 3 daughters with his wife Harriet. Charles Alfred Edwards and John Frederick Edwards were the sons who joined their father’s business. Charles had formerly been a lace merchant but John appears to have worked for Edwards & Jones from an early age. 167 Regent Street was given up but 159 was added to their address. The business continued at least until 1928.

Edwards & Jones stocked an extensive range which included Dressing Cases, Country House Letter Boxes, Chess Sets and Games compendiums and Inkwells. They were also retailers for items manufactured by De La Rue & Co.",0

The subjects of the engravings are a Lapland woman, a Katchintzian Tartar woman, and a Tartar woman from the Teleouti tribe. 

The first engraving likely portrays a female inhabitant of Lapland, which would typically feature clothing suitable for the cold climate of the region, such as fur-lined garments and possibly layers to insulate against the harsh temperatures.

The second engraving is presumed to represent a Female Katchintzian Tartar, which might show clothing that includes elements of both Russian and Asiatic styles, as the Katchintzian Tartars were known for their distinctive and vibrant dress, reflecting their cultural traditions and the practical needs of their daily lives.

The third engraving probably depicts a Female Tartar of the tribe of Teleouti, likely highlighting the unique cultural aspects of the Teleouti tribe through clothing, which would include ornamental patterns, possibly signifying the wearer's social status, marital status, and regional affiliations.

The attire in these engravings would be meticulously detailed and colorful, reflecting the diverse cultural heritage within the vast territories of Russia at the time. These costumes would not only serve practical purposes but also carry significant cultural meanings, embodying the wearer's identity and community ties.

William Alexander's ""Picturesque Representations of the Dress and Manners of the Russians"" was an ambitious project that provided a comprehensive visual account of the traditional dress and customs of a wide range of Russian people. Such publications were crucial for educational and cultural exchange, offering Western audiences a glimpse into the lives and traditions of communities they might never have the chance to encounter firsthand. The careful attention to detail in such works ensured that they remained valuable resources for those studying the history of dress and cultural practices.

Published by Johannes Bugenhagen in 1525.

This extremely rare book is in good condition for its age. Some losses to the spine and cover, but otherwise extremely good. The text is almost perfect despite some minor foxing, amazing for its age.

We are of the opinion that this book was rebound in the early to mid-19th century.

Leather edges and pebble board jacket with gilt edge and gold lettering.

As an added bonus, the book comes with a label belonging to its original owner, Major William Alexander Obenchain, a Civil War personality who served on General Robert E. Lee's Staff, and after the War became President of Ogden College in Bowling Green, KY (now the University of Western Kentucky).
As an Added Bonus, the book is signed by previous owners to Major Obenchain on the title page what appears to be ""T. Ruthart 1710"". We have 'no doubt' that this is an early 18th century signature.
AS an Added, Added Bonus, the book is also signed by a previous owner on the second last page with what appears to be ..."" G.H. Duckham 1810"".
This book was part of the extensive private collection of the Calvert Hall/Obenchain/Godwin/McMillan Collection formerly of Bowling Green, KY and later, Highland Park, Texas.
The Obenchain Family have roots in Germany in the 17th and early 18th centuries.

This remarkable and historically significant antique terracotta portrait plaque bears the signature of the artist, Jean-Baptiste Nini, renowned for his expertise in creating terracotta portrait plaques during the 1700s in Paris. The plaque features a hand-crafted relief portrait of King Louis XVI in side profile, capturing the monarch's distinctive aquiline nose, curls, a ribbon securing his low ponytail and a wrapped collar, fashionable with French monarchy of the time.

Jean-Baptiste Nini's unique technique of casting terracotta entailed the use of refined local clay, processed using elutriation prior to being molded by finely detailed engraved copper molds to create his sought-after terracotta portraits.

The plaque is tastefully encased within an exquisite round French dore bronze frame, intricately carved with stylized feather motifs in relief. A movable hanging ring in dore bronze, also beautifully hand-carved in relief resembling a wreath, adorns the piece. The dore bronze rectangular clasps at the back neatly and securely hold the plaque in place.

The artist's signature and the date ""1780"" are inscribed below the bust. Jean-Baptiste Nini's medallions, especially those depicting eminent figures like King Louis XVI, are rare finds. Notably, the Metropolitan Museum of Art houses a collection of Nini's medallions, yet this particular piece remains exclusive to private collectors, making it a cherished gem for art enthusiasts.

This well-preserved and scarce artwork is sure to captivate the heart of any discerning art collector. Over time, the terracotta has acquired a lovely patina, with darker areas that highlight its depth and add character.

This terracotta portrait plaque by Jean-Baptiste Nini is a testament to the artist's exceptional skills and an invaluable historical artifact that immortalizes the likeness of one of the most iconic figures in French history. Beyond its artistic beauty, it serves as a window into the cultural ambiance of Paris in the 1700s, making it a truly remarkable and prized piece of art from a bygone era.",0

An absolutely sublime suite of eight vintage dining chairs. They are as mentioned vintage, hand carved from beech with a flamed mahogany finish and with thick English cattle hide leather upholstery. The frames are absolutely sublime

The suite has been lightly restored to include a deep clean, hand condition wax and hand polish, the leather seats have a heritage vintage finish to them, the idea being they look 100 years old from new, they have picked up normal patina marks here and there as you can see, it all adds to the look and feel but if the new owner wishes, they can be hand dyed and made better than new for the cost price

Provenance: Torridon House

Torridon House is situated on the northern shore of upper loch Torridon, beneath the dramatic mountain ridges of Beinn Alligin and Liathach, the house was built by Duncan Darroch in 1876 on an estate bought from the McBarnets and previously the possession of the Lords of the Isles. The architect was Alexander Ross, who built inverness cathedral. Constructed from the famous Torridon red sandstone, it was designed for family living, as well as to support parties during the shooting and fishing seasons. In the early 20th century it changed hands several times until it was bought by the 4th Earl of Lovelace in 1960. The Lovelaces had previously lived at Ben Damph on the south side of the Loch, which had been in their possession since 1886. Torridon is currently the home of the 5th earl and his wife.

The Lovelace title belongs to the King family, who trace their history back to Exeter. Sir Peter King (circa 1669-1734) was the maternal nephew of the philosopher John Locke, regarded as one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers and known as the ‘Father of Classical Liberalism’. A portrait of him hangs in one of the rooms at Torridon. Sir Peter was called to the bar in 1698 and returned to parliament in 1700. From 1714 he was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and was made Lord Chancellor in 1725. An impressive portrait of Sir Peter as Lord Chancellor hangs in the dining room at Torridon (see illustration). He was created Baron King of Ockham (the family seat being Ockham Park) in the same year and two years later was a pall bearer at the funeral of Sir Isaac Newton.For several generations they remained Barons King of Ockham, until Sir William, 8th Baron (1805-1893) was raised to the Peerage as 1st Earl of Lovelace in Queen Victoria’s Accession Honors list of 1838. In 1835 he had married Ada Byron, only daughter of the celebrated poet Lord Byron. She was an important figure in her own right; a mathematician and writer, she is known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical computer and is often regarded as the first computer programmer. In 1840 the 1st Earl became Lord Lieutenant of Surrey, a position he held until his death over fifty years later. He acquired Horsley Towers, built by Sir Charles Barry, and set about expanding it in the Gothic style from the 1840s. There are a number of significant items of Gothic furniture at Torridon which probably trace their roots back to this aggrandizement. He also improved both Ockham Park and Ashley Combe in Somerset in an Italianate style between the 1830s and 1860s. It was he who added the Ben Damph Estate in Torridon to the family’s properties in the 1880s.",0

Wool pile of symmetric knots on a wool foundation
Designed by Gavin Morton
The Donegal factory in Killybegs was established by Gavin and Alexander Morton of the Scottish carpet firm of Morton’s about 1893. Gavin Morton designed many of the early pieces and employed Celtic and Anatolian designs initially. Oushak carpets were popular at the time for British and foreign middle-class houses and it was therefore easy to capitalize on the trend while “improving” the resulting pieces. Liberty of London was already selling these Turkicised carpets by the 1890’s.
This carpet employs the dark blue field as a dramatic foil for the bold, one-way, ascending palmette pattern. Full ragged palmettes are aligned on a slender vertical central staff, while the half width offset similar run up the sides. 
The palmettes are supported by lower-level triples of ecru six petal rosettes and straight stems. There is a third layer of stems and small florets. The main border is done in a straw-old ivory tone, with branching palmettes along the sides, elaborate doubled palmettes fanned out in the corners, smaller elliptical ragged palmettes between, and hyacinth sprays filling in.  These sprays are directly adapted from Oushak weavings.
 It looks like an Oushak, but resembles no known Turkish carpet. The weave on Donegals is always coarse with large motives and areas of plain color.  The carpets were executed on vertical looms by local Irish women. After the William Morris/Voysey carpets, these are the best known of Arts and Crafts carpets. 
The carpets followed cartoons allowing for varied colorways and sizes. A carpet of this size took about three months of knotting time. The Donegal factory continued in operation until the 1950’s. Ireland has always been known for its vast flocks of sheep and this piece is in excellent condition with a thick and long pile of local wool. There are no fine weave Donegals, with weaving usually running about 30-40 knots per square inch, with some coarser. 
Following Donegal, other carpet works were established in Ireland, but none have achieved the consistent fame of Donegals. Their coarse weave and symmetric knots makes them easy to repair. This carpet is in good condition and shows no repairs.

Killybegs, Ireland 
Early 20th century
Gavin Morton Design
Wool pile of symmetric knots on a wool foundation.

Morton’s of Scotland was creating mostly machine woven carpets since the middle of the nineteenth century. Gavin Morton, a second generation proprietor, saw a market in hand knotted carpets when they began to arrive in the British market in quantity from Turkish centers like Oushak.  However, the Oushak trade was already controlled by merchants who would soon amalgamate into Oriental Carpet Manufacturers. But there were other sources and these were closer to home, and fell within the cost profile. Ireland, in particular, was the home of both low wages and skilled craftswomen willing to learn a new trade.  Alexander Morton was the founder of the firm of Morton’s, but his son James ran the business side of the firm, and it was he who in 1896 first set up looms at Killybegs. Carpets became readily available by 1900, in both the British Islands and America.  A larger factory was opened in 1901. His brother Gavin was more attracted to the artistic, design side of the work and with Robertson and Voysey designed the large majority of Donegal carpets. Designs were eclectic, covering both traditional Irish Celtic patterns and more “Oriental”, primarily Oushak, designs. 
The firm operated until the 1950’s. 

This “Turkey red” carpet eschews borders.  At each end of the field is a verdant vase supported on two slender stems.  These bushes converge in a notched open diamond with “weeping willow” variants on the diagonals. At the corners are bent right angle floret sprays. Rosettes grow from broken stems developing from horizontal extenders of the main motif. The whole effect is that of a centered, but not overtly medallion, layout. The color palette is narrow, including red, cream and black. One could see it as a Turkish village yastik (cushion cover) blown up to vast room-size. The weave is quite coarse and the carpets were intended for a middle class clientele, going with wallpaper, furnishings and accessories. They were marketed primarily through Liberty of London.  The carpets in this design, as most of Donegals were, came in various colorways, and there are examples with cream and dark blue grounds. Unlike Oushaks which were produced in quantity, Donegal carpets were woven in smaller numbers and have always been relatively uncommon. The designs pare away extraneous elements and one is left with the essence. This simple, but not simplistic, boldness and strength, has made them popular in almost any but the most elaborated settings. In the early 20th century, they graced the homes of many of the newly affluent British middle classes.

Flat-woven Donegal carpet with a border of stylized meandering foliage contained in continuous green squares. The border frames a very open allover pattern of floral sprigs on a soft pink ground.

The simple pale rose pink and green colorway and certain design elements to the border are suggestive of Walton’s preference for a simplified and unfussy aesthetic which increased the impact of his furniture and induced a ‘feeling of rest’.

Émile Louis Picault (24 August 1833 – 1915) was a French sculptor, best known for works depicting allegorical and patriotic subjects, and mythological heroes. Picault was a very prolific artist, producing sculptures, over 500 models in total—with the Egyptian figures being his most sought after, during his long sculpting career. He began to show his artwork at the Salon beginning in 1863.[1] He signed the majority of his work as "" Picault"".
Scribes were people in ancient Egypt (usually men) who learned to read and write. Although experts believe that most scribes were men, there is evidence of some female doctors. These women would have been trained as scribes so that they could read medical texts.

Johannes Klinckerfuss was one of the most important German cabinet makers of the early 19th century who was known for his exceptional craftsmanship. He was recommended by Roentgen to the Bayreuther Hof of Herzog Friedrich Eugen von Württemberg, where he was in charge of the furnishing of Schloss Fantaisie. In 1795 Klinckerfuss worked in the herzogliche Kabinettschreinerei for the Stuttgarter Hof, where he became cabinet-ebeniste for Duke Frederick II of Württemberg, later the first king of Württemberg. In 1812 Klinckerfuss opened his own workshop in Stuttgart, where he made numerous important pieces in the Empire style. Many of these still remain in the Schlosses, including Weil (near Esslingen), Ludwigsburg, and Rosenstein.",0

Each with an ovoid body applied with an ormolu band depicting winged figures feeding with panthers, the top and base with pierced foliate and palmette mounts, with hippocampus-form handle terminating in a ram's mask, on malachite shaft and square base, minor variations to chasing, particularly to handles. These precious ewers, with their striking and unusual malachite bodies, were likely made to appeal to the Russian market. Malachite is most closely associated with the Russian Imperial Factories of the 18th and 19th centuries, whose highly skilled stone-cutting led to the creation of some of the most beautiful objets d'art. The Imperial administration held the sole right to mine for malachite from the Ural Mountains, so the products of these factories were almost exclusively destined for Imperial palaces or to be given as diplomatic gifts, making them very desirable. These ewers were created using the technique of ‘Russian mosaic,” where malachite is sawn into very thin slices, applied to a stone or metal ground with the veins laid to form pleasing patterns and then polished, making the joins barely visible. By creating malachite objects that call to mind the Imperial Factories of Russia and mounting them with fine ormolu details, the makers of the present ewers deftly balance Russian taste with French refinement.
The ovoid form of the ewers with their slender elongated spouts and figural handles are closely related to the oeuvre of the bronzier Claude Galle (1759-1815). Galle flourished during the Empire when he supplied bronzes and ormolu mounts for furniture, clocks and other decorative items to Compiègne, Versailles, Saint-Cloud, the Grand Trianon, and various other Courts throughout Europe. These ewers are similar to Galle's 'maiden' vases and his popular series of ewers, examples of which are illustrated in H. Ottomeyer, P. Pröschel et al., Vergoldete Bronzen, Munich, 1986, vol. I, figs. 5.12.6, 5.12.8 and 5.12.9, pp. 364 – 365 and are also at Pavlovsk, illustrated in E. Ducamp ed., Pavlovsk The Collections, Paris, 1993, p. 179. The vases and ewers all bear exquisitely detailed handles, mostly in the form of winged maidens rather than the more rare hippocampi figures employed on the present pair.

Woodall.  Etched and Ccid Washed.  This 19th century wine cooler’s charm is held within its neoclassical imagery and vivid blue cut-to-clear colorway. Depicting a scantily-clad woman draped in translucent robes, hair pinned around the crown of her head, and wielding a scepter of grapes, this image is made with Ancient Greek and Roman art in mind. The woman is surrounded by elongated acanthus leaves that coil into loose spirals. Above and beneath her are thick blue lines that differentiate the frieze from the mouth and base of the vase. The lines contain delicate palm patterning and scalloped hearts. Thin gilding adorns the rim, base, and handle attachments on the vase.  Each section is beautifully hand-cut from blue-over-clear crystal and further adorned with 24K gilt decoration.  The piece is all etched and acid washed with extraordinary quality and craftsmanship.  George Woodall is well known for being one of the most important cameo crystal/glass cutters of the 1800's.  The piece is signed, ""G Woodall"".
Founded in 1837, Thomas Webb & Sons quickly established a reputation as the “Crystal King of England,” cementing this title with prizes at London’s Great Exhibition of 1851 and Paris’ Exposition Universelle of 1878. Prompted by the success of Portland Vase replicas by competitors Northwood and Locke, Thomas Webb & Sons shifted its focus from crystal to cameo glass by 1880, hiring George and Thomas Woodall, who formed the firm’s Woodall Team. The Woodall brothers, who trained as apprentices at J. & J. Northwood and later served as designers at Dennis Glass Works, revolutionized cameo glass with both technical innovations and aesthetic achievements. The Woodalls developed and utilized blue-tinged, rather than opaque, white glass gradually removed to produce a wide range of shades over a plum or burgundy ground, creating a semi-transparent, luminous effect. They also employed cutting wheels extensively in order to increase efficiency and meet the public’s voracious demand. George Woodall, considered the greatest cameo glass artist during its height from 1880 to 1910, was renowned for the breadth of his design sources, including Neoclassical and Oriental, his technical prowess, and his prolific output.",0

The Decanter extensively decorated throughout the body with two large fern leaves stemming from a central tied ribbon in the form of a bow. The decanter features a rounded handle fitted to the upper half of the decanter with a hinged shaped lid opening with gravity. To the base of the decanter an engraving reading “Jesse Collings. from I.

The Decanter is complete with its original latched fitted box lined in purple velvet with gold stringing to the exterior and the retailers mark to the inside doors “Widdowson & Veale, Goldsmith & Jewellery, to the Court of Spain, 73 Strand London.”

Widdowson & Veale George Widdowson (b. 1804 Lincoln – Died 1872 Dulwich Village) was a celebrated silversmith and goldsmith although he took the route of retailer rather than a craftsman and by the age of 28 he had taken over his uncle’s London shop on the Strand, London. His uncle John Salter had been a close friend of Lord Nelson’s daughter, Horatia, and was godfather to one of her children. The shop was very successful and John Salter had supplied Nelson with many pieces of jewellery, including mourning rings.

Widdowson developed the shop into Widdowson & Veale located at No. 73 Strand on the corner of Adam Street and opposite the Adelphi. Widdowson had a real eye for marketing. He once had a detailed newspaper article dedicated to his proposal to make a copy of Aeneas’ shield, as described in Virgil’s Aeneid. There is no evidence the shield was ever made though it did get good publicity.

The company made swords and other weapons for the British army and navy, orders and decorations for the British court and were goldsmiths and jewellers to the court of Spain. In 1842 on the christening of Queen Victoria’s eldest son (later King Edward VII), Widdowson’s eye for publicity meant that the firm gave a christening gift of ‘an immense silver coronet supporting the Prince of Wales feathers.’ Widdowson & Veale were also makers to HRH the Duke of Sussex and the Court of Spain.

In 1844, George was 40 and his business was doing well, as was the economy as a whole. The firm were able to advertise for apprentices, asking for a premium of £100. On 11 February 1847 George married Eliza Duffield (nee Boville), the daughter of a Putney wine merchant who had been living in Gibraltar but returned when her first husband, John Duffield, died. George and Eliza were middle-aged when they married and did not have children.

Alexander Macrae founder of the firm that went on to be C J Vander Ltd. Macrae was recorded at 32 Bow Street, Covent Garden, London September 1856. He was joined in partnership by Martin Goldstein c. 1870, whereupon the style of the firm was changed to Macrae & Goldstein – first listed in 1871 as a silversmith. Alexander Macrae supplied many of the great firms at that time such as Elkington, Harry Emanuel, Hunt & Roskell and of course Widdowson & Veale.

The writer of this work is William Alexander, and it was published by John Murray in 1814. This work aimed to illustrate and describe the traditional dress and customs of various Russian peoples, including indigenous groups, at the beginning of the 19th century. It serves as an important historical record of cultural attire and practices of that era. The detailed colored engravings were a common method of such documentation in a time before photography, intended to provide the Western audience with a visual account of distant cultures.

The three engravings depict individuals from the Yakut people, also known as the Sakha, an ethnic group who live in the Russian republic of Sakha (Yakutia). These images are specifically labeled as a Yakouti Tartar, a female Yakouti, and an unmarried female Yakouti. 

The first image shows a Yakouti Tartar. This individual is depicted wearing a heavy coat adorned with intricate patterns and fur trimming, possibly indicating the cold climate they inhabit. The coat features a high collar and is cinched at the waist, flowing down to the mid-thigh. The sleeves are detailed with patterned bands at the wrists. The person wears boots and a hat with colorful details, possibly indicating a status or role within the community.

The second image presents a female Yakouti in traditional dress. Similar to the first figure, she is also clothed in a heavily adorned and fur-trimmed coat, highlighting the cultural emphasis on warmth and functionality in attire. Her outfit is ornamented with distinct patterns and appears to have an apron-like garment over the front, suggesting a layering of clothing typical of the region's traditional dress. Her headwear is less elaborate than the male's but still features colorful decoration.

The third image features an unmarried female Yakouti, distinguished by her attire and possibly her headwear or hairstyle, which may reflect her marital status according to cultural norms. Her coat is ornate, with colorful embroidery and fur trim, similar to the others but with its unique style and pattern, hinting at her individual status or family affiliation.

All three figures are standing in a neutral pose, which was common for portraiture of this period. The detailed colored engravings were designed to provide Western audiences with a visual account of distant cultures and are an essential historical record of cultural attire and practices from the early 19th century. These representations are valuable for understanding the traditional clothing and social structures of the Yakut people during this time.

The Yakut people, also known as the Sakha, primarily reside in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), which is a large federal Russian republic in northeastern Siberia. Yakutia is known for its extreme climate, with some of the coldest winter temperatures on Earth, vast wilderness, and sparse population. The Yakuts have traditionally been engaged in occupations like horse breeding and cattle raising, adapted to the severe climate of the region. Their culture, language, and traditions are distinct and have been preserved over centuries, even with the changing political landscapes.",0

Enid Bell Palanchian (American, 1904 – 1994) a/k/a Mrs. E. B. Palanchian, Mrs. Enid Bell Palanchian and Mrs. Missak Palanchian was an important American sculptor, author, illustrator and professor who was primarily active in the New York/New Jersey area, but who established a respected body of work recognized throughout Europe and the United States as reflected by awards received in Paris, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico and Florida. Her achievements included numerous public works projects (e.g., the design of the Congressional Gold Medal) on display at public institutions and museums around the country, private commissions and sales throughout the world, group and solo exhibitions, generous donations of art and compilations, and the passing on of her knowledge and skills to 24 years of art students of the Newark School of Industrial and Fine Arts.

Enid Bell was born in London, England, and later studied at the Glasgow School of Art and then at the St. John’s Wood Art School; as well as studying with fellow Scot Sir William Reid Dick in London. Then, after moving to the United States, she taught at the Art Student League in New York City at Miss Chapen’s School. Essentially a figurative, direct carving in wood artist, she was based in New Jersey where she became the head of the sculpture program of the Fedral Art Project for that state and was herself the creator of several FAP commissions. In 1932, she married Armenian/American businessman and artist, Missalk Palanchian athough she retained her name “Bell” for professional purposes. Following the end of the Federal Art Project in 1944, she taught as instructor of sculpture and Head of the Sculpture Department of the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Art until 1968, and was active was a member of the National Sculpture Society. Enid Bell died in 1994 in Englewood, New Jersey.

Each beetle is meticulously illustrated, likely hand-colored after printing, which was the style of the mid-19th century scientific illustrations. The image includes a key at the bottom, which provides the names of the beetles in French, such as ""SPHENOQNCATHE primordie"" and ""PHILODTE de humboldt,"" among others. (see below).

These illustrations were part of an entomological reference in ""Dictionnaire Classique des Sciences Naturelles"" by Pierre Auguste Joseph Drapiez. These beetles would have been represented to aid in the scientific study and categorization of insect species. Given the detail and the quality of the illustrations, these plates were valuable educational tools for scholars and enthusiasts of natural history at the time.

The condition of the print suggests it has been preserved with some signs of aging, such as yellowing and spotting, which adds to its antique charm. The precision of the drawings indicates a high level of scientific rigor in depicting the anatomical features of each beetle, which would have been crucial for the scientific community's efforts to classify and understand the vast diversity of insect life.

The print is a typical representation of entomological studies from the 18th and 19th centuries, where detailed illustrations were crucial for the study and classification of living creatures. 

This print not only serves as a scientific record but also as a work of art, reflecting the dual interests of the Victorian era in both natural history and illustration. It is a remarkable piece that would be a significant addition to any collection of natural history art or an elegant decorative piece for those with a taste for the historic and the natural world.

The style of the illustration is reminiscent of 19th-century scientific prints, which were often used in natural history books to document various species.

More info on the book in which it was published:

The 'Dictionnaire Classique des Sciences Naturelles' by Pierre Auguste Joseph Drapiez stands as a remarkable testament to 19th-century natural sciences. Published in Brussels in 1845, this work represents an expansive collation of knowledge, building upon the pioneering works of Buffon, Daubenton, Lacepede, Cuvier, de Jussieu, and other influential naturalists.

The prints within this compendium likely showcase a rich amalgamation of artistic precision and scientific accuracy. Drapiez, himself a Belgian naturalist, would have aimed for detailed representations of flora, fauna, and scientific phenomena, mirroring the illustrative styles prevalent during his time. Given the era's emphasis on illustration, these prints were likely engraved meticulously, possibly portraying intricate anatomical details or lifelike depictions of the natural world.

With Drapiez's background in natural history, the prints might bear testament to his commitment to scientific authenticity, aiming to educate and inspire scholars and enthusiasts alike. These engravings would have complemented the text, offering visual aids that elucidate the concepts and specimens discussed in the volume.

Overall, the prints of 'Dictionnaire Classique des Sciences Naturelles' likely serve as both artistic representations and invaluable scientific resources, encapsulating the essence of 19th-century natural history exploration and documentation.

More details about the beetles:

The names are listed in French. Here is a translation and identification where possible:

1. **SPHENOQNCATHE primordie** - This name does not correspond to a current scientific name and may be an outdated or misspelled term. It could be a historic or archaic name that has since changed.
2. **PHILODTE de humboldt** - This likely refers to a beetle named in honor of Alexander von Humboldt, but the name does not correspond to modern nomenclature.
3. **PASSALIE de Gory** - Passalidae is a family of beetles, also known as bess beetles or patent-leather beetles. ""de Gory"" could refer to the person who described the species or a specific species within this family.
4. **CALCONATHE du cheval** - This name is not recognizable in modern entomological taxonomy and might be an archaic term or a specific common name that has since fallen out of use.
5. **STIRE à côtés** - The word ""stire"" is not identifiable as a modern scientific term; it might be an outdated or misspelled name for a type of beetle.
6. **MOULRE de pierrt.** - This could be an incorrectly transcribed or an old-fashioned name for a beetle species, unrecognizable in contemporary taxonomy.
7. **OPATRE gris** - ""Opatre"" could be an old name for a group of beetles, possibly meant to be ""Opatrum,"" which is a genus within the family Tenebrionidae. ""Gris"" means gray in French.
8. **LEJODE canelle** - This name is not immediately identifiable in the context of modern entomology.
9. **SPHENISQUE peint.** - ""Sphenisque"" does not correspond to a current beetle genus, and ""peint"" means painted in French, perhaps referring to the colorful appearance.
10. **HALOGNE humérale.** - The term ""halogne"" is not recognized in current scientific beetle taxonomy.
11. **DYTILDE lasse.** - This may be a misspelling or an old name; it doesn't match any known beetle taxonomy.
12. **MYODITE américain.** - This could refer to a beetle from America, but ""Myodite"" is not a recognized genus.
13. **MLOE d'olivier.** - The name is not recognizable as a modern scientific term and could be an archaic name or a common name based on habitat or food preference (olivier means olive tree in French).

It's important to note that taxonomy, the scientific naming of organisms, has evolved over time. Many species that were once grouped under a particular name may have been reclassified. The names listed here are likely from a historical context and may not correspond directly to the way insects are classified today. For precise identification, the scientific community would need to refer to updated taxonomic databases or literature.

Evelyn Ackerman helped shape the California mid-century aesthetic. She approached her designs with an appreciation for folk stories, antiques and toys, creating tapestries, mosaics, wood carvings and pottery that came to embody the modern American arts and crafts movement.

Born in Detroit in 1924, Ackerman studied art and art history at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, where she met her husband Jerome, who was studying ceramics. They married in 1948 and she received her MFA in 1950. In 1949, Evelyn and Jerome visited the Detroit Art Institute and saw the influential exhibition For Modern Living, curated by Alexander Girard, which piqued their interest in modern design. In 1952 The couple moved to Los Angeles and established Jenev Design Studio to produce their own works, beginning with Jerome's pottery. After endorsements by leading designers like Paul McCobb and features in House & Garden and the Los Angeles Times, the couple expanded their enterprise, opening a mosaic studio in Mexico for Evelyn and renaming their venture ERA Industries. Evelyn took on most of the creative work of designing while Jerome managed the business and production.

Evelyn's style ranged from geometric abstraction to whimsical figuration, with a keen eye for global folk craft techniques and motifs. She was also known as a scholar, publishing several books on dolls, antiques and craft.

Though Evelyn and Jerome slowed ERA Industries production in the 1980s, both continued to work in the modern folk aesthetic they helped bring to prominence. They received the Henry Award for their contributions to California design from the Museum of California Design, Los Angeles in 2008 and a retrospective of their work followed in 2009 at the Mingei International Museum, San Diego. Evelyn passed away in 2012 and Jerome in 2019, leaving behind an influential body of work. - Source: Toomey & Co.",0

His works of art can be found in Stanford University, New Orleans Museum of Art, and many other important institutions and collections. This is one of his masterpieces and a must have for any Munier collection. Exceptionally hand painted in the finest oil paints in the prime of his career. During the 1890s Munier continued to paint peasant, mythological and religious subjects; he also portrayed animals, scenes depicting fishing, landscapes and seascapes. Many of his works featured his children as his models, particularly his daughter. The size and quality of this oil on canvas are second-to-none. Oil on canvases at this size usually depreciate in quality, however, Munier is an expert artist and his works of art are always extremely life-like and painted with exceptional care and perfection.

Wylie & Lochhead Glasgow, Scotland; furniture makers & retailers (fl.1829-1957)

Robert Wylie began business on his own account in Glasgow in 1817 and in 1828 moved to 80 Trongate, established as an upholsterer and hair and feather merchant. William Lochhead started work in his father’s post-hiring, undertaking and cabinet-making business. Wylie married Margaret Downie in 1824 and Lochhead married her sister, Janet, the following year. In 1829 Wylie and Lochhead formed a partnership as general upholsterers, furnishers and funeral undertakers, and took second floor premises at 164 Trongate. 

Their early success was largely due to high demand for undertakers following the cholera epidemic of 1832 and, with this increased reputation and an eye for new styles and technical developments, their stock of furnishings expanded. The accounts for 1834 showed an annual turnover of £4,438 but by 1844, with two more stores at Saltmarket and Bell Street, the turnover had increased to £30,613. In the 1870s the company was the first of the Glasgow furnishers to specialise in ship and yacht interiors. By the 1880s they had showrooms, factories and warehouses throughout Glasgow (feather works in Dorset Street, upholstery workshop at Mitchell and Unions Streets, paper-staining in Whiteinch and a large cabinet-making workshop in Kent Road with an adjacent carving, gilding and plate-glass silvering works).

Branches were later established in London and Manchester and they had network of agents and buyers throughout Europe and the Empire. In 1882 Wylie and Lochhead employed 1700 people and on 20 August 1883 they were registered as a limited company. George Logan, apprentice cabinet maker in Beith, joined the Wylie & Lochhead in 1882 as a trainee and stayed until 1937 by which time he was chief designer. Ernest Archibald Taylor was a draughtsman at Scott & Co. Ltd, the Clyde shipyard, before starting with Wylie & Lochhead in 1893/94 also as a trainee designer. As well as training their own apprentices, they employed students from the Glasgow Schools of Art and Technical Colleges. Among these were Jessie King, David Gow and John Ednie. Many of their designers taught at the Glasgow School of Art and the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College and acted as local examiners; there was a Wylie & Lochhead prize for furniture design.

The Glasgow International Exhibition of 1901 was an opportunity to show their work with great panache. The exterior of the pavilion was designed by David Gow and the inside by George Logan, John Ednie and E.A. Taylor, who were each given a specific room. The Cabinet Maker and Art Furnisher, August 1901, described the Wylie & Lochhead pavilion as ‘unquestionably the most important furnishing display’ (illus. The Decorative Arts Society 1850-1932 (1985), pp. 8, 10 & 11). They made most of the furnishings for the Exhibition themselves, with carpets specially woven by Alexander Morton & Co. and stained glass made by Hugh MacCullouch & Co. A mahogany bookcase, with stained and leaded glass, mother of pearl, white metal mounts and leather inserts, which was designed in 1900 by Logan for the Rossetti library at the 1901 Exhibition, is now at the V&A Dundee.

Where appropriate their designers incorporated work of other artists and craftsmen in their schemes including cushions embroidered by Ann MacBeth, prints by Rossetti, a large Burne-Jones tapestry and appliqué work in the library and bedroom by Godfrey Blount. A clock designed by C. R. Ashbee was displayed in the Royal Reception Rooms at the Exhibition. However, Wylie & Lochhead was keen to show a brand image and not promote individual designers, so its souvenir booklet stressed that ‘The entire exhibit can be reproduced, if desired, in a simpler or more elaborate type of the same character’. 

The show led to a prestigious commission from Margaret MacConnachie and her husband Robert Hay Coats to furnish, to Taylor’s designs, their new house at 32 Radnor Road, Handsworth, near Birmingham. A more extensive commission which included panelling, fitted furniture and elaborate stained glass, was for the Pollokshields town house of William Weir, later Lord Weir of Cathcart, for which Taylor won a medal and diploma at the 1902 Turin exhibition. The entire 1901 pavilion was selected for display in an exhibition of British Arts and Crafts held in 1902 at the Imparmüvészeti Musum in Budapest and the host museum acquired various items from their display.

At the Turin International Exhibition of 1902 their designers, Logan, Ednie and Taylor, were allowed to exhibit in their own right. Logan exhibited the ‘Rose Screen’, a three-panel screen executed by Wylie & Lochhead, and described in Studio Magazine, 1902 p.99 as ‘a novel treatment of wood, silver, precious stones, and chains of silver strung with pearls and turquoises, the central panel containing a framed drawing by Jessie M King, of The Princess of the Red Rose; altogether a most dainty production’. The screen and a matching desk were purchased by Walter S. Strang, a Scotsman who immigrated to Australia in 1890s, in 1929. Eight years later the desk was destroyed in a fire but the screen was restored and then exhibited in The Folding Image: Screens by Western Artists of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, National Gallery Of Art, Washington DC in 1984 and is in the permanent collection of the Glasgow Museums Collection (E.1986.52).

In addition to exhibition furniture they produced less elaborate ranges of furniture under such labels as ‘Arts and Crafts’, ‘Quaint’, ‘New Art’ and ‘Artistic’, with some pieces available in a variety of woods and colours. The ‘Saxon’ and other Windsor chairs were purchased from High Wycombe by Wylie & Lochhead at this time. An example of a chair inlaid with woods and mother of pearl featured in their catalogue of early 20th century is illustrated in Agius (1978), p.122.

By 1908 Ednie and Taylor had left Wylie & Lochhead and by 1916 further additions to the Glasgow properties had been made. At Cleveland Street they had five floors of almost 21,000 square feet, the Kent Road workshop comprised almost 40,000 square feet and they had workshops or outlets at Belgrave (now Beltane) Street, Graeme (now Bell Street) and College and High Street. Stores opened in Manchester and in Bloomsbury London, the latter still trading as late as 1930, while land had been acquired in the Natal. 

They held royal warrants as cabinet makers and upholsterers to Queen Victoria, the Prince of Wales, King Edward VII, King George V and King George VI. For the International Exhibitions in 1888, 1901, 1911 and 1938 the Royal Suites were furnished by Wylie and Lochhead. At the 1888 exhibition the suite comprised two retiring rooms and a dining room; the latter featured dark coloured ‘Scottish Baronial’ oak furniture (illus. Kinchin and Kinchin (1988), p. 23) and now at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow. They were also involved in the interiors of the Royal Yacht Britannia, the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth liners. Also supplied cabinet work at Australia House, London; The British Museum; Lloyd’s Shipping Boardroom; Skibo Castle and Lloyd’s Bank in the early 20th century.

They continued to exhibit and Robert Wylie, as a member of the board of the Scottish Furniture Manufacturers’ Association, in January 1929 responded positively the idea of the Glasgow School of Art receiving a prize for Furniture Design. In 1947 they held The Swedish Home Exhibition at their Buchanan Street, which was sponsored by the Council of Industrial Design and in 1951 under Scottish Furniture Manufacturers Ltd’s banner their furniture was chosen by the Council of Industrial Design Selection Committee and displayed at South Bank's Festival of Britain. Their 1951 sales catalogue illustrated the Cintique Chair, covered in ambia leather, designed by Ernest Race. In May 1956 a new Edinburgh store was opened but by this time Robert Wylie was in negotiations to sell. Discussions were held first with Waring and Gillow and then with Great Universal Stores but finally in September 1957 a formal announcement was made confirming the sale of Wylie and Lochhead to the House of Fraser.

Interesting Additional Information:

History:
The original Pine Cone egg is a jewelled enameled Easter egg made under the supervision of the Russian jeweler Peter Carl Fabergé in 1900. The egg was made for Alexander Kelch, who presented it to his wife, Barbara (Varvara) Kelch-Bazanova.

Designed:
The egg was created by workmaster Michael Perkhin (Russian, 1860–1903) and is crafted of gold, silver, rose-cut diamonds, brilliant diamonds and translucent royal blue enamel. The miniature elephant is made of silver, gold, ivory, rose-cut diamonds and red and green enamel. One end of the pine cone, a symbol of resurrection, is set with four petal-shaped portrait diamonds, forming a quatrefoil enclosing the date ""1900"". The opposite end is set with a rose-cut diamond star, enclosing a portrait diamond over a later miniature of a young woman. The Egg originally bore the monogram B.K.(for Barbara Kelch) beneath the portrait diamond, probably similar to that of the 1899 Kelch Twelve Panel egg. The egg shell opens to reveal, in a fitted velvet compartment, a surprise, an oxidized silver Indian elephant automaton with ivory tusks supporting an enameled turbaned mahout seated upon a gold fringed red and green guilloche enamel saddle cloth. Each side is set with three rose-cut diamond collets, one covers a keyhole. When wound with the original gold key, the tiny elephant, lumbers forward, shifting its weight from one side to the other, all the while turning its head and flicking its tail. The egg has a height of 9.5 cm.

Ownership:
One of the six Kelch Eggs sold to Morgan in Paris by A La Vieille Russie. The Egg was sold in 1929 to a private United States collector. Sold in 1989 by Christie's Geneva to Joan Kroc (widow of Ray Kroc, former chairman of McDonald's) of San Diego, California for $3.1 million. Daniel Grossman, a New York art dealer, represented Joan Kroc at the sale and he stayed on the telephone with her throughout the bidding. Mrs. Kroc later told the New York Times ""I was thrilled when I was told I had bought the egg."" She had recently pledged $1 million to San Diego's 1989 three week arts festival ""Treasures of the Soviet Union"" and the Egg was the 26th Faberge egg at the festival. In 1997 the egg was offered by Christie's in New York in a sale which was headlined by the Fabergé-heavy collection of William Kazan, but did not sell with the highest bid of $2.8 million. The presale estimate was $3.5 to 4.5 million."

This marvelous figure is after the incredible Meissen designer Johann-Joachim Kaendler (Kändler), the most famous sculptor at the Meissen factory, and is of exceptional craftsmanship and design. The illustrious model is fitted with some truly unusual and breathtaking facets that demonstrate the exceptional quality and craftsmanship that Meissen is synonymous with. This is the best example of the Meissen Tailor that we have ever handled.

This piece was designed in the 1730s, by Johann-Joachim Kändler, and commissioned by Count Brühl, Chief Administrator to the King. The Count was known to be the most dapper person in Saxony, the old Germany. Understandably, the Count's tailor felt as though he was equally responsible for the Count's success in his sense of style. Over time, the tailor become more vain and narcissistic, to that point that he demanded the Count speak with the King and offer him a place to dine. The Count would never make any request like that to the King, and instead thought of a solution where the tailor could be at the dinner without having to ask. The Count went to Kändler and commissioned an object that looks like the tailor. Kändler was known to have a charismatic and whimsical personality and when the Count described what he wanted, Kändler put his own flair on the piece and created an ostentatious and quite humorous model of the tailor seated on an equally stylish billy goat. All in all, the Count kept his word on getting a seat for the tailor to dine with the King, except, it was the porcelain model of the tailor who was honored with the invitation. Found underneath are the signature Meissen blue crossed swords mark used for the years 1815-1924 with ""No. 107"" incised. The original design of ""Count Brühl’s Tailor on a Goat” is featured in Meissen Portrait Figures by Len and Yvonne Adams. The figurine is also featured in an original oil painting by Carl Wilhelm Anton Seiler named Count Brühl's Goat, found in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.

Hollywood Cinema’s Golden Era remains one of the most prominent influences across contemporary art and culture worldwide. Born in California in the 1920s, the Hollywood Regency style emerged from interior design: opulent, bold, and playful. Characterized by decadent adornment and palatial magnificence, Hollywood Regency furniture informed domestic design for generations. This set of gilt brass mid-century modern chest of drawers manufactured by the Mastercraft Furniture Company exemplifies the grandeur of Hollywood’s golden years and its lasting impact on art.
This pair of dressers is fashioned with three drawers for storage each. The drawer handles are formed into Chinese characters that signify the four dynasties, inside of which are lined with cedar. Strictly rectangular with strong bold lines, the dresser features both garishness and practicality—the deep gold color combines with the dresser’s form in a chic combination of luxury and utility. Descending from a long line of cabinet makers, the Doezema brothers returned from World War II and founded the Mastercraft Furniture Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1947. They set out to design sleek furniture with sophisticated industrialist elements. The company is known for their high-quality workmanship and high-value materials for products, increasing the value, quality, and workmanship of its furniture. With detail in both material and form, Mastercraft was committed to providing both aesthetic and practical quality in their furniture. After nearly 30 years in business, the brothers established a legacy of synthesizing traditional and vogue styles to create unique work characteristic of the post-war period.

Beautifully hand-carved and enameled with a bright white body and black enamel eyes. This piece is really superb and in fabulous condition for its age. In Chinese culture, the water buffalo symbolizes the coming of spring. Throughout China the spring season began with a ceremonial plowing by the imperial capital through the use of a water buffalo, symbolizing its importance to the imperial heritage. Water buffalo were created in China for centuries, with terracotta pieces found in Han dynasty tombs. By creating these porcelain blanc de chine sculptures, it was thought that spring would arrive more quickly. This piece is a testament to Chinese heritage and demonstrates the consistent high-quality objects that the Chinese have put forth for many generations.

Former Property of Adolph Henrich Joseph Sutro's famous Cliff House and indoor public swimming establishment, The Sutro Baths - San Francisco, California.

Sutro was born in Prussia on April 29, 1830. He made a fortune building tunnels during the California Gold rush. He then moved to San Francisco and increased his wealth by turning to Real Estate. His investments included such iconic San Francisco places as Land's end (which include Lincoln Park and the current Cliff House) and of course the Sutro Baths. Although he served as San Francisco's 24th Mayor he is perhaps best remembered for the landmarks that bear his name.

Sutro also had a passion for collecting. His library which was destroyed in the 1906 fire was said to be the largest private library in the world. His compulsion for collecting reflected a keen intellect with eclectic tastes.

In 1896 he built a new house – a seven story Victorian which became known as ""the Gingerbread Palace"" below his estate on the bluffs of Sutro Heights. Here his collector's eye returned to the Classical and he lined the bluffs around his house with an array of Mythological and Iconic statues creating the effect of a Greek temple. In keeping with his populist view Sutro opened his home and the grounds to the public on Sunday. Vistors included local working families, the cities social elite as well as three US Presidents.

Sutro died in 1898. In the thirties, the Whitney family took possession of the Cliff House and in the 70's when they closed Playland and Sutro Baths they decided to offer the public an opportunity to own a bit of San Francisco history from these memorable sites as well as what was left from the original collection acquired by Adolph Sutro.

The sale began on January 22, 1971 at the Cliff House and lasted eleven days. According to an article in the San Francisco Examiner dated Jan 15, 1971 ""Egyptian mummies, an Alaskan kayak, bathing suits used at the 1900 Sutro natatorium, marble statues..."" were on sale. Those lucky enough to participate were indeed able to preserve a piece of history as evidenced in the offered lots.

The Apollo Belvedere

The Apollo Belvedere or Apollo of the Belvedere also called the Pythian Apollo is a celebrated marble sculpture from Classical Antiquity. It was rediscovered in central Italy in the late 15th century, during the Renaissance. From the mid-18th century, it was considered the greatest ancient sculpture by ardent neoclassicists and for centuries epitomized ideals of aesthetic perfection for Europeans and westernized parts of the world.

The Greek god Apollo having shot a death-dealing arrow, the episode represented may have been the slaying of Python, the primordial serpent guarding Delphi making the sculpture a Pythian Apollo; alternatively it may represent the slaying of the giant Tityos, who threatened his mother Leto, or the episode of the Niobids.

The Apollo is thought to be a Roman copy of Hadrianic date (ca. 120-140) of a lost bronze original made between 350 and 325 BC by the Greek sculptor Leochares.

Renaissance

Before its installation in the Cortile del Belvedere, the Apollo which seems to have been discovered in 1489 at Anzio, or perhaps at Grottaferrata where Giuliano della Rovere was abbot in commendam apparently received very little notice from artists. It was, however, sketched twice during the last decade of the 15th century in the book of drawings by a pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio, now at the Escorial. Though it has always been known to have belonged to Giuliano Della Rovere before he became pope, as Julius II, its placement has been confused until as recently as 1986: Cardinal Della Rovere, who held the titulus of San Pietro in Vincoli, stayed away from Rome for the decade during Alexander VI's papacy (1494-1503); in the interim, the Apollo stood in his garden at SS. Apostoli, Deborah Brown has shown, and not at his titular church, as had been assumed.

Once it was installed in the Cortile, however, it immediately became renowned and a demand for copies of it arose. The Mantuan sculptor Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi, called ""L'Antico"", made a careful wax model of it, which he cast in bronze, finely finished and partly gilded, to figure in the Gonzaga collection, and in further copies in a handful of others. Albrecht Dürer reversed the Apollo's pose for his Adam in a 1504 engraving of Adam and Eve, suggesting that he saw it in Rome. When L'Antico and Dürer saw it, the Apollo was probably still in the personal collection of della Rovere, who, once he was pope as Julius II, transferred the prize in 1511 to the small sculpture court of the Belvedere, the palazzetto or summerhouse that was linked to the Vatican Palace by Bramante's large Cortile del Belvedere. It became the Apollo of the Cortile del Belvedere and the name has remained with it, though the sculpture has long been indoors, in the Museo Pio-Clementino at the Vatican Museums, Rome.

In addition to Dürer, the Apollo was sketched and copied by several major artists during the late Renaissance, including Michelangelo, Bandinelli, and Goltzius. In the 1530s it was engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi, whose printed image transmitted the famous pose throughout Europe.

18th and 19th centuries

The Apollo became one of the world's most celebrated art works when in 1755 it was championed by the German art historian and archaeologist Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717-1768) as the best example of the perfection of the Greek aesthetic ideal. Its ""noble simplicity and quiet grandeur"", as he described it, became one of the leading lights of neo-classicism and an icon of the Enlightenment. Goethe, Schiller and Byron all endorsed it. The Apollo was one of the artworks brought back to Paris by Napoleon after his 1796 Italian Campaign. From 1798 it formed part of the collection of the Louvre during the First Empire. After the fall of Napoleon (1815), it was repatriated to the Vatican where it has remained ever since.

The neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova adopted the fluency of the Apollo Belvedere for his marble Perseus (Vatican Museums) in 1801. The Romantic movement, however, was not so kind to the Apollo's critical reputation. William Hazlitt (1778-1830), one of the great critics of the English language, was not impressed and dismissed it as ""positively bad"". The eminent art critic John Ruskin (1819-1900) wrote of his disappointment with it. Finally, starting something of a trend among later commentators, the art critic Walter Pater (1839-1894) adverted to the work's homoerotic appeal by way of explaining why it had been so long lionized. Nevertheless, the work retained much popular appeal and casts of the it were abundant in European and American public places (especially schools) throughout the 19th century.

About the artist:

Ferdinando Vichi was a central figure in the production of Florentine sculpture at the end of the 19th century. He is associated with the sculptors Cesare Lapini, Pietro Bazzanti and Guglielmo Pugi, all of whom executed works at The Galleria Bazzanti. The gallery, originally Bazzanti's studio, was inaugurated in 1822 and is still open today. His compositions are varied in subject matter, ranging from busts after the Antique to orientalist themes and Renaissance-inspired models. Like many other late nineteenth-century sculptors, Vichi often took inspiration from classical antiquity. The English inscription ""Made in Italy"" suggests the present sculpture was carved for export to England or America. Historicising romantic subjects were very popular in Italian sculpture of the late 19th century.

History:
A reliquary (also referred to as a shrine, by the French term châsse or monstrance) is a container for important religious relics.

The earliest reliquaries were essentially boxes, either simply box-shaped or based on an architectural design, taking the form of a model of a church with a pitched roof. These latter are known by the French term chasse, and typical examples from the 12th to 14th century have wooden frameworks with gilt-copper plaques nailed on, decorated in champlevé enamel. Limoges was the largest production centre; NB the English usage differs from that of the French châsse, which denotes large size rather than shape.

Relics of the True Cross became very popular from the 9th century onward and were housed in magnificent gold and silver cross-shaped reliquaries decorated with enamels and precious stones. From about the end of the 10th century, reliquaries in the shape of the relics they housed also became popular; hence, for instance, the skull of Pope Alexander I was housed in a head-shaped reliquary. Similarly, the bones of saints were often housed in reliquaries that recalled the shape of the original body part, such as an arm or a foot.

A philatory is a transparent reliquary designed to contain and exhibit the bones and relics of saints. This style of reliquary has a viewing portal to view the relic inside. The feretrum was a medieval form of reliquary or shrine containing the sacred effigies and relics of a saint.

During the later Middle Ages, the monstrance form, primarily used for consecrated hosts, was sometimes used for reliquaries. These housed the relic in a rock crystal, or glass capsule mounted on a column above a base, enabling the relic to be displayed to the faithful. Reliquaries in the form of large pieces of metalwork jewellery also appeared around this time, housing tiny relics such as pieces of the Holy Thorn, notably the Holy Thorn Reliquary now in the British Museum.

Condition:
Superb museum quality examples, in excellent original unrestored antique condition with beautifully aged patina. Wear consistent with age and use. Heavily patinated - scattered oxidation. Overall wonderful examples.

Typically reliquaries were not sold in pairs, so to find a matching pair such as this is exceptionally rare.

A truly masterpiece from Namikawa Sosuke workshop.

Namikawa Sosuke (1847–1910) was a Japanese cloisonné artist, known for innovations that developed cloisonné enamel into an artistic medium sharing many features with paintings. He and Namikawa Yasuyuki (no relation) were the most famous cloisonné artists of the 1890 to 1910 period, known as the ""golden age"" of Japanese enamels. Around 1880 he set up and ran the Tokyo branch of the Nagoya Cloisonné Company. He exhibited his artworks at national and international expositions, where he took an organising role. 
He was recognised as an Imperial Household Artist and created art works for imperial residences.

Alexander Calder (1898 – 1976) Alexander Calder was born in 1898, the second child of artist parents, his father was a sculptor and his mother a painter. (His grandfather was Alexander Milne Calder.)
Despite showing artistic talents at an early age, Calder did not originally set out to become an artist. He instead enrolled at the Stevens Institute of Technology after high school and graduated in 1919 with an engineering degree. Having worked for several years after graduation at various jobs, Calder committed to becoming an artist and in 1923 he enrolled at the Art Students League, New York to launch his career as an artist.
Calder soon began to sculpt from wire many portraits of his friends and public figures of the day. Word travelled about the inventive artist, and in 1928 Calder was given his first solo gallery show at the Weyhe Gallery in New York. This exhibition was soon followed by others in New York, Paris, and Berlin.
He married Louisa James (a grandniece of writer Henry James) in January 1931. He also became friendly with many prominent artists and
intellectuals of the early twentieth century at this time in Paris, including Joan Miró, Fernand Léger, James Johnson Sweeney, and Marcel Duchamp. 
In October of 1930, Calder visited the studio of Piet Mondrian in Paris and was deeply impressed by a wall of coloured cardboard rectangles that Mondrian continually repositioned for compositional experiments. For two weeks following this visit, he created solely abstract paintings, only to discover that he did indeed prefer sculpture to painting. Soon after, he was invited to join Abstraction-Création, an influential group of
artists, including Jean Arp, Mondrian, and Jean Hélion with whom he had become friendly.
In 1931, Calder created first truly Kinetic sculpture and gave form to an entirely new type of art. Many of these early objects moved by motors and were dubbed “mobiles” by Marcel Duchamp. Calder soon abandoned the mechanical aspects of these works when he realized he could fashion mobiles that would undulate on their own with the air’s currents. Arp, in order to differentiate Calder’s non-Kinetic works from his Kinetic works,
named Calder’s stationary objects “stabiles”.
In 1933, Calder and Louisa left France and returned to the United States, where they purchased an old farmhouse in Roxbury, Connecticut. Calder converted an icehouse attached to the main house into a studio. Because metal was in short supply duringthe war years, Calder turned increasingly to wood as a sculptural medium. Working in wood resulted in yet another original form of sculpture, works called “Constellations” by Sweeney and Duchamp. With their carved wood elements anchored by wire, the Constellations were so-called because they suggested the cosmos, though Calder did not intend that they represent anything in particular.

His first American gallery, The Pierre Matisse Gallery held an exhibition of these works in the spring of 1943, Calder’s last solo show at that gallery. His association with Matisse ended shortly thereafter, and he took up with the Buchholz Gallery/Curt Valentin as his New York representation.
The forties and fifties were a remarkably productive period for Calder, which was launched in 1938 with the first retrospective of his work at the George Walter Vincent Smith Gallery in Springfield, Massachusetts. A second, major retrospective was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York just a few years later, in 1943. In keeping with his economy, Calder made a series of small-scale works in 1945 primarily from
scraps of metal trimmed while making larger pieces.
In 1949, Calder constructed his largest mobile to date, International Mobile, for the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s Third International Exhibition of Sculpture. Galerie Maeght in Paris also held a Calder show in 1950 and subsequently became Calder’s exclusive Parisian dealer. His
association with Galerie Maeght lasted twenty-six years, until his death in 1976. After his New York dealer Curt Valentin died unexpectedly in
1954, Calder selected Perls Galleries in New York as his new American dealer, and this alliance also lasted until the end of his life.

Calder’s artistic talents were renowned worldwide by the 1960s by the range and breadth of his various projects and commissions.

Reflecting the tenets of Futurism, Constructivism and early non-objective painting, Alexander Calder changed the course of modern art with his three-dimensional Kinetic sculptures, ‘the mobiles’, which Calder’s consist of boldly coloured abstract shapes, which are made from Industrial materials and hang in lyrical balance.
Calder is best known for these visually fascinating and emotionally engaging, along with his monumental outdoor bolted sheet metal stabiles, which only imply movement and is one of the most-recognizable and beloved modern artists.
He also made a smaller number of sculptures in the more-traditional materials of wood and bronze and did paintings, mostly in gouache as well as drawings, including illustrations for books, and prints, and was also an inventive designer of jewellery.
Calder was an international phenomenon during his lifetime. He won the grand prize for sculpture at the 1952 Venice Biennale, where he represented the United States. He earned the French Legion of Honour and the American Presidential Medal of Freedom, among other honours.
Calder has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Rijksmuseum, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art and the Museo Reine Sofia. 
His work regularly sells for eight figures on the secondary market.",0

This incredible bronze piece was cast after a model by Maarius-Jean-Antonin Mercié, This model is signed 'F. BARBEDIENNE FONDEUR PARIS' demonstrating that it was cast by Ferdinand Barbedienne's foundry, the best bronzier of the 19th century. The base is further signed 'A. Mercie' and stamped 'Réduction Mécanique' with an inscription of '659'. The figure is mounted on a Belgian noir marble base with various stepped edges. Gloria Victis is one the most well-known and important bronze casts of the 19th Century. The quality of this particular model is absolutely incredible and all the marking indicate that this particular piece is one of the finest produced by the Foundry.

A student of Jouffroy and de Falguière at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Marius-Jean-Antonin Mercié (1845-1916) won the Grand Prix de Rome at 23 years old with his work Thésée vainqueur du Minotaure. In 1872, he sent the plaster model of his work David vainqueur to the Salon, for which he won the first class medal. At the same time, he received La croix de la Légion d'honneur at the Villa Medici. His return to Paris, in 1874, issued in a long and brilliant career with numerous commissions, notably the monuments for Louis-Philippe and Queen Marie-Amélie for the Royal Chapel at Dreux (1886).

By the age of 30 Mercié was already very well-known and his Gloria Victis received resounding success when it was exhibited at the Salon, in 1874 (in plaster) and in 1875 (in bronze). This work exalted the heroism and the patriotic sentiments aroused by the disasters of 1870. His predilection for patriotic subjects is shown in many of his works such as Quand même, the celebrated bronze group erected at Belfort in 1884, and Jeanne d'Arc relevant l'épée de la France at Domrémy in 1902.

From 1880, Mercié began painting but it was his sculpture that won him awards and medals. In 1892, he entred L'Institut de France and in 1913, three years before his death, he was nominated as president of La Société des artistes français.",0

The renown Parisian Firm Raingo Frères was one of the better established bronziers and clockmakers of the 19th century. The business was founded in 1813 and established at 8 rue de la Touraine by 1830. Around 1860 they carried out work for Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie. As well as making clocks and clock cases in their own right, they acted as fondeurs for a number of important artists, amongst them Pradier, Carrier-Belleuse and August Moreau. The design of the winged term-figures are after the design for the mounts on a pair of commodes supplied by André-Charles Boulle (French, 1642-1732) for the bedchamber of Louis XIV at the Grand Trianon in 1708.

Exceptionally cast, hand-chiseled and further burnished and matted with two-tone gold, this dore bronze grouping of two neoclassical lovers is of the upmost quality and craftsmanship. As Pierre-Philippe Thomire is regarded as one of the greatest bronzier's of the late 18th century and early 19th century, this dore bronze piece could only be made by someone with his artistic talents. The lovers are seen with the man seated on a cushioned bench with tasseled ends. His lover has her head rested on his while they stare into each other's eyes. The man is playing a traditional lyre beautifully hand-chiseled and exceptionally detailed with swan head ends. On the ground near the man's feet is a fire urn flanked by three rams heads and mounted on three rams feet. The quality of each section of this piece is absolute second-to-none. Every aspect of this piece is meticulously hand-crafted with exceptional precision. Each hair is perfectly hand-chased and chiseled to be as life-like as possible, and the clothing of each of the lovers seems as though it's made of silk and not gilt bronze because of its free-flowing smooth characteristics. Any angle you look at this piece is as perfect as the last. Attention to detail was absolutely the first and foremost attribution to this piece, as no section lacks perfection. The dore bronze lovers are mounted on an exceptional rectangular marble base.

""Bust of Thais""

Signed in cast along shoulder ""E. Villanis"" and cold stamped ""1146"" with foundry cachet of ""Societe des Bronzes et Paris"" verso

Item # 305KOA20Z

An exquisite and expertly cast example of Emmanuel Villanis' Thais, it features a delightful reddish oxide surface patination throughout the skin of the courtesan with a highly nuanced patina to the integral socle, garment and hair with traces of brown, black, gilt, silver, reddish-brown and burnished bronze that has only lightly patinated. The figure captures the courtesan of Alexander the Great, eventual wife of Ptolemy I, the famed instigator of the Burning of Persepolis by Alexander the Great. It is thought that she led the burning of the great palace in sport, jest and underlying revenge for the burning in her homeland of the Temple of Athena on the Acropolis by Xerxes during the Persian war. The cast is sealed to the reverse with the editeur's cachet and numbered 1146 by cold-stamping.

Measurements: 21 1/2"" H x 12 1/4"" W x 5 1/8"" W (base) x 4 5/8"" D (base)

Condition Report: Very good condition. Significant patina variation throughout the chaotic areas with some degree of relieving between various patinas, likely intentional. Cleaned, waxed and a fine presentation.

This floral motif Galle lamp is made in the art nouveau style with two-toned deep red flowers on a base and shade. The sharp edges of the floral design, which is all hand-carved, complement the smooth round mushroom-shaped shade and base.  The rounded shape and delicate hand-carved glass of multiple colors and hues is a signature of Galle lamps. They typically form a cap-like shade over the thin tourine base. Another important feature of the lamp is the rounded finish on the rim, the glass is smooth at the rim—a sign that the lamp is authentic.  This lamp exudes the soft romanticism of Art Nouveau. Gallé was a prominent glassblower and one of the most influential figures in the French Art Nouveau movement.

This remarkable vase is attributed to the workshop of Charpentier & Cie., and stands as an exquisite fusion of sumptuous black marble, intricately detailed patinated bronze, and opulent gilded embellishments.  Drawing inspiration from the storied legacy of ancient Greece, this vase showcases a profusion of intricate motifs and details painstakingly rendered upon its black marble canvas. 

Both the upper rim and the interior of the vase are adorned with gilt borders, while the interior itself is impeccably finished with smooth ormolu mounts, providing a luxurious contrast to the opulent exterior.  The upper section of the vase presents a captivating tableau, where stylized, curling wings extend gracefully upwards, supported by sphinx-like creatures on either side. These graceful forms reach upward to meet the hand-carved and gilt rim, creating a seamless transition between the various sections of the vase. 

Ormolu handles, meticulously crafted in intricate scrolled foliate designs, are elegantly anchored on either side by highly ornate patinated bronze scrolls. The lower section of the belly of the vase features delicate spire-like motifs.  Gracing either lower side, the enigmatic Grecian sphinx figures take their place, distinguished by finely chiseled features and gilded accents that cast an enchanting aura. These sphinxes, characterized by their bearded masks and ornate necklaces, are poised atop masks of mythical males wearing gilt wreaths. These masks, replete with stylized beards and distinctive open mouths revealing a captivating gilt stylized tongue, add an extra layer of intrigue to the composition.  The masks are further elevated upon marvelously patinated clawed feet, which, in turn, gracefully support the vase within a quadripartite structure and rest with poise upon a circular base plinth.

This beautiful Geisha is modeled after the Japonisme movement brought up by French artists integrating Japanese artistic styles into their art work. During the mid-1870s, the demand for Japanese decorative arts, fashions, woodblock prints, screens, porcelains and the like, became quite the craze among well-to-do Europeans. Artists took note and drew inspiration from the Japanese aesthetic. It became known as Japonisme, or the French ‘Japonisme’, and you can see these influences in many works from the mid to late 19th century. Some painters opted to integrate eastern themes and techniques in their work from the comfort of their studios, posing beautiful Geisha's, such as this one, wearing magnificently hand-painted komodos' with vibrant reds and gorgeous flowers throughout the outerwear.

The body of the vase is a gorgeously hand painted with raised gold and enamel decoration of a turtle and various other decorations, making it seem as though the turtle is swimming in a lake.

Mene. This silvered bronze depicts an Arab falconer on horseback, signed P.J. Mene in cast to naturalistic base. The sculpture depicts a male figure on horseback, the duo adeptly cast, hand-chassed, and hand-chiseled with exceptional craftsmanship. The group was then completly silvered, creating a marvelous finish on the bronze. The man holds his arm over his head to catch the eponymous falcon. The moment depicted is one of great momentum: the horse, reins pulled by the rider, slows, the tension in its body palpable, as the falconer attempts to retriever his falcon. The Orientalist piece is an unsurpassed example of animalier sculpture, both in terms of its craftsmanship and subject matter.
The base is signed ‘P. J. Mêne’.
Pierre Jules Mêne (French, 1810-1879) first exhibited at the salon of 1838 and would become one of the most renowned members of the group known as Les Animaliers. Widely regarded for his naturalistic and ability to capture subjects in a 'fleeting moment', Mêne was highly awarded for his work, receiving the Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1861. Mêne's strength is well demonstrated in the Mounted Falconer through the lively handling of the falcon, depicted with wings flapped as it begins to take flight.",0

The crystal section is masterfully hand-crafted and hand-painted with absolute precision. The scene demonstrates three neoclassical figures, one man who is seen rowing a canoe while a maiden is resting on the lap of another man. In the background is a beautiful castle with gorgeous forest scenes and flowing clouds. The side of the crystal is also signed by the artist (as seen in the photos). The crystal is finished with 24-karat gilt decoration on the upper rim and figures. The crystal is mounted on a rectangular dore bronze mount which is signed with the ""Baccarat"" seal mark stamped on the bottom.

1. The first engraving depicts the Female Shaman in a standing position, facing the viewer. She is adorned in a long blue dress with red trim and intricate patterns, which is likely indicative of her spiritual role. The dress is complemented with fringes and decorative elements that may hold symbolic meaning within her culture. She holds a tambourine in one hand and a feathered object in the other, both of which are traditional shamanic tools used in rituals and ceremonies for healing, divination, and communication with the spirit world.

2. The second engraving offers a rare view of the back of the Female Shaman's dress, providing a full perspective of her attire. The details on the back part of the dress are just as elaborate as the front, featuring lengthy fringes and possibly amulets or tokens that would be part of her spiritual regalia. Her headgear, with its distinctive upright feathers, serves both a ceremonial purpose and as a symbol of her connection to the spiritual realms.

William Alexander’s works, such as these engravings, played a crucial role in recording the diverse cultural heritage of the Russian Empire’s many peoples. The vibrancy and accuracy of these illustrations would have provided one of the only means for people in the West to visualize the traditions and attires of communities they might never encounter in person. As such, these images are a vital part of historical record-keeping, offering not only artistic but also anthropological insights into the cultures represented.

A very fine French 19th century polychromed and patinated bronze sculpture of ""Aida"" resting on a sphinx, her legs crossed and holding a gilt-bronze tambourine, after the model by Gaston Veuvenot Leroux ""Aida, A Femme Au Tambourin Assise Sur Une Tete De Sphinx"".

The opulent and extensively detailed version of Aida was inspired by ethnographic findings of the mid-19th century in ancient Egypt as well as the influences of theatre and costume design. Travelers to the East had often recorded their journeys, either in writing or in pictures, but the movement of Egyptomania was wider-reaching than Egyptology. The immensely popular vogue of Egyptomania is without doubt due to the success of performing arts in recreating this era, in particular, Giuseppe Verdi's Aida. Both the Cairo and Paris premieres created sensations so large that they influenced generations of artists from Alexander Cabanel to Cecil de Mille. In Aida, the ruins of Egypt were brought back to life in full color and scale before the eyes of a generation that would make history as romantics, adventurers and explorers.

The Cairo premier of Aida was entirely conceived by one of the foremost Egyptologists of the day, Auguste Mariette, who was assigned to the project by Khedive Ismail Pasha himself. His involvement with the set and costumes contributed to the success of the piece. Verdi, who had twice turned down the Khedive's invitation, was inspired by Mariette's synopsis of the opera delivered to him in 1870, and agreed to compose the music for the work. Mariette's primary concern was the challenge of transforming two dimensional hieroglyphs and large stone statues into characters on a stage. In one of his letters dated Paris, 15 July 1870, he states: 'Finding the proper balance, through studying the ancient costumes discovered in the temples and adapting them to the demands of the modern stage, is a delicate task. A king may be quite majestic in granite with a huge crown on his head, but when we endow him with flesh and blood, and have him walk and sing, it may get awkward and embarrassing. We must be wary of one thing ... provoking laughter'. Mariette's final costumes for Aida were a satisfying re-creation of ancient Egyptian attire and his marvelous sets transported the spectators at the Cairo premiere to the time and land of the pharaohs, which is why the preparations revolving around the 1880 Paris premiere were so highly anticipated. For the Paris opening, Pierre-Euge`ne Lacoste was responsible for designing the costumes. He was a more experienced designer than Mariette and his costumes for the opera were better-fitted, carefully researched and more authentic. Artists inspired by the Egyptian revival collaborated extensively and demonstrated the possibilities of mixing styles.

Van Meter, Louisville, John P. Morton & Company 1901.

This rare book is in great condition for its age, with some very minor 'knicks' on the edges of the spine but otherwise pretty perfect.

Brown jacket with gold lettering.

As an added bonus ..... the Book comes with a Label belonging to it's original owner, Major William Alexander Obenchain, a Civil War personality who served on General Robert E. Lee's Staff, and after the War became President of Ogden College in Bowling Green, KY (now the University of Western Kentucky).

The Book was presented to Major Obenchain by his Cousin and it is inscribed on the rear of the first page as follows:- "" W.A. Obenchain From Cousin Charles J. Van Meter March 14, 1902.""

You will not find this book anywhere else!!
What makes this book special is not only the fact, that it was owned by a prominent Civil War personality (Major W.A. Obenchain) but also that Major Obenchain was an extended relative of the Author (a Cousin).
What makes this book really specialist that it contains both a correction or ""ERRATA"" entry by B.F. Van Meter (the Author) before the Preface and a number of corrections by Major Obenchain in relation to several entries and 4 Pages of Notes and Corrections by Major Obenchain after the end of the Book at Page 183.
From our research, the University of Virginia has an original copy of this First Edition Book .... BUT ..... it does not have these corrections ..... making this book truly Historic from the point of view of a contemporaneous correction by an important family member of the Genealogy of the Families Concerned !!!

If you are a member of the van meter family,
A Kentucky or Virginia museum or university .....
Then this book is essential for your collection!!",0

Last page of a hand written letter, circa 1885-1890.

Probably written in New York City following his retirement in 1884, as referenced in the last sentence.

Fully handwritten (probably by a Secretary) BUT personally signed by General William Tecumseh Sherman.

The letter is a single folio lined and margined letter with writing on the front only.

It is also marked by it’s original owner as “Autograph of General Sherman” and the owner’s name “Mrs. Obenchain”.

It Reads:

“supposed to live here at my home as quietly as circumstances will admit of.

With great respect,

Yours very truly

W.T. Sherman

General.”

Comes with our COA.

In an interesting ‘twist’ to this autograph, Mrs Obenchain was in fact, Eliza Calvert Hall (a renowned author from Bowling Green, KY) who was married to Captain (later promoted to Major) William Alexander Obenchain, who fought on the Confederate Side in the Civil War and was attached to the Virginia Corps of Engineers and served on General Robert E. Lee’s Staff. Captain Obenchain surrendered to General Sherman at Greensboro, North Carolina on the 1st May 1865.

We have his surrender/parole paper in our collection which is being sold together with Capt. Obenchain’s EXCEPTIONALLY RARE & HIGHLY IMPORTANT Battlefield Map for Richmond, VA in 1864, listed/posted separately.

We understand from the ‘family lore’ that Major Obenchain, held General Sherman in very high regard, because of his humane treatment of POW’s and in particular, officers …… which probably explains why his wife obtained the autograph for him!

William Tecumseh Sherman (/t?'k?ms?/ tih-KUM-s?; February 8, 1820 – February 14, 1891) was an American soldier, businessman, educator, and author. He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861–1865), achieving recognition for his command of military strategy as well as criticism for the harshness of the scorched-earth policies that he implemented against the Confederate States. British military theorist and historian B. H. Liddell Hart declared that Sherman was “the most original genius of the American Civil War” and “the first modern general”.

Provenance: From the Estate of Eliza Calvert Hall/Obenchain

Condition: Very good. Some fold marks, some yellowing of the paper with age. No tears. In acid free plastic cover, with COA.",0

The map features detailed geographical and political boundaries, showcasing various regions, cities, rivers, and mountains within the Ottoman European territories. The map was created by Pierre Antoine Tardieu, a renowned French engraver, steel engraver, and cartographer known for his high-quality work.

Map Details:

- **Title**: Carte de la Turquie d'Europe
- **Creator**: Pierre Antoine Tardieu (1784-1869)
- **Publication Date**: Early 19th century
- **","**: Approximately 34.5 x 43.5 cm (13.5 x 17.25 inches)
- **Features**: The map includes a detailed representation of the European territories of the Ottoman Empire, with place names, rivers, mountains, and regions clearly marked. The title cartouche is located in the upper left corner, and the mile scale is presented in the lower left.

Around the year 1800, the region referred to as ""European Turkey"" or ""Ottoman Europe"" was a significant part of the Ottoman Empire, which was one of the most powerful empires in the world at the time. Here are some key aspects of European Turkey during this period:

### Geographic Scope

European Turkey included a large part of Southeastern Europe, encompassing modern-day:
- Greece
- Bulgaria
- Romania (specifically the regions of Dobruja and parts of Wallachia)
- Serbia
- Albania
- Montenegro
- Bosnia and Herzegovina
- Parts of Croatia, Macedonia, and Hungary

Political Structure

- **Ottoman Administration**: The region was governed by the Ottoman administrative system, which divided territories into provinces (vilayets) and smaller administrative units (sanjaks). Each province was overseen by a governor (pasha) appointed by the Sultan.
- **Autonomy and Vassal States**: Some areas within European Turkey had varying degrees of autonomy or were vassal states. For example, Wallachia and Moldavia (in modern-day Romania) were vassal principalities that retained local rulers under Ottoman suzerainty.

Society and Demographics

- **Ethnic Diversity**: The region was extremely diverse, home to numerous ethnic groups, including Turks, Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, Albanians, Vlachs (Romanians), and Jews, among others.
- **Religious Diversity**: There was significant religious diversity, with Islam being the dominant religion due to Ottoman rule, but large Christian (Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic) and Jewish populations coexisted.

Economy

- **Agriculture**: The economy was largely agrarian, with agriculture being the primary occupation. Key crops included grains, tobacco, and cotton.
- **Trade and Commerce**: European Turkey was strategically important for trade, connecting the Mediterranean with Central Europe and the Black Sea. Major cities like Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), Thessaloniki, and Belgrade were key commercial hubs.

Culture

- **Cultural Influence**: The region was a melting pot of various cultures, influenced by Byzantine, Slavic, and Ottoman traditions. This mix was reflected in architecture, cuisine, music, and customs.
- **Education and Language**: The official language of administration was Ottoman Turkish, but many local languages were spoken. Education was often conducted in religious institutions, with different communities maintaining their own schools.

Challenges and Conflicts

- **Internal Strife**: The Ottoman Empire faced numerous internal challenges, including administrative inefficiency, corruption, and local uprisings.
- **External Threats**: The empire was also under pressure from external forces, particularly from the Habsburg Empire, Russia, and later from nationalist movements within the Balkans, which sought independence or autonomy from Ottoman rule.

Decline of Ottoman Power

By 1800, the Ottoman Empire was experiencing a gradual decline, which would intensify throughout the 19th century. This period saw increasing nationalist sentiments among various ethnic groups within European Turkey, leading to uprisings and eventual wars of independence, such as the Serbian Revolution (1804-1835) and the Greek War of Independence (1821-1829).

Overall, European Turkey around 1800 was a complex and diverse region under the Ottoman Empire's waning control, characterized by a rich tapestry of cultures, economic activities, and political structures.

Condition Overview:

1. **Paper Quality**: The map exhibits signs of aging, such as yellowing along the edges, which is typical for documents of this age. The paper remains in good condition without major tears or damage.
2. **Edges and Corners**: The edges are slightly worn, with minor fraying and a few small tears that do not significantly impact the map's readability or aesthetic value.
3. **Center Fold**: There is a visible center fold, common for maps that were folded for storage or publication. The fold is in good condition without significant wear but with splits on both sidess.
4. **Color and Print Quality**: The colors used to outline the boundaries remain vibrant and clear. The print quality is excellent, with sharp, legible text and detailed illustrations.
5. **Staining and Spots**: There are a few spots and stains, particularly near the edges and along the fold. These do not obscure any critical details of the map.

Historical and Artistic Value:

Pierre Antoine Tardieu was known for his meticulous craftsmanship and contributions to cartography. His work drew the attention of prominent figures such as Alexander von Humboldt. Tardieu's maps were among the first to use steel engraving, a technique that allowed for greater detail and precision.

This map is not only a valuable historical document, offering insights into the geography and political landscape of the Ottoman Empire's European territories, but it also stands as an example of the cartographic art of the period. Its preservation and condition make it a prized piece for collectors and historians alike."

With the European market entranced with all the oriental fantasy that their homes would allow, artists and artisans turned to the source for additional sales. Thus, items believed to appeal to the fantasy were made for export. Clocks of all forms were great favorites. As the industrial revolution gathered steam (pun intended) and advances in the industry gave birth to more accurate clocks combined with more and more designs; the 19th century can be said to be the golden age of timekeeping.",0

An original framed portrait etching of Alexander McKellar, the ""Cock o' the Green"" by John Kay. a Scottish caricaturist and engraver. The picture depicts Alexander McKellar with his long nose golf club setting up to hit the golf ball. A selection of long nose club lay on the floor beside him, text accompanying the image 'By the La' Harry, this shall not go for Nothing, Cock Of The Green, J Kay 1803'.

Alexander McKellar, the ""Cock o' the Green"" was obessed by golf spending most of his time on Bruntsfield Links. When not playing golf McKellar served as a doorkeeper at an epsicopalian chapel in Edinburgh on Sundays.

From Wikipedia:-
John Kay was born in April 1742 in Gibraltar Cottage just south of Dalkeith, Scotland, where his father, John Kay, worked as a mason. His mother, Helen Alexander, owned several properties in Edinburgh and the Canongate and was relatively wealthy. When his father died in 1748, John was sent to live in Leith, the harbour area of Edinburgh, with some of her relatives, who treated him very badly. At age 13 he returned to Dalkeith where he was apprenticed to George Heriot, a barber in the town, whom he served for six years.

In 1761 he went to Edinburgh, where he served 7 years as a journeyman but not being an Edinburgh citizen had to purchase the freedom to trade as a barber from the Society of Surgeon-Barbers, which he eventually did in December 1771 at age 29, on payment of £40. He then set up business on the High Street in Edinburgh. He had several high ranking clients and made friends with several, notably William Nisbet of Dirleton who became a constant companion.

In 1784 he began engraving his drawings and published his first caricature: James Robertson of Kincraigie, ""the daft highland laird"". In 1785, induced by the favour which greeted certain attempts of his to etch in aquafortis, he took down his barber's pole and opened a small print shop in Parliament Close. There he continued to flourish, painting miniatures, and publishing at short intervals his sketches and caricatures of local celebrities and oddities, who abounded at that period in Edinburgh society. From 1785 he abandoned his business as barber to concentrate on drawing. This was facilitated by annuities paid to him by Sir Henry Jardine and the estate of William Nisbet.

Kay's portraits were collected by Hugh Paton and published under the title A series of original portraits and caricature etchings by the late John Kay, with biographical sketches and illustrative anecdotes (Edinburgh, 2 vols. 4to, 1838; 8vo ed., 4 vols., 1842; new 4to ed., with additional plates, 2 vols., 1877), forming a unique record of the social life and popular habits of Edinburgh at its most interesting epoch. Kay's famous shop on the Royal Mile was destroyed during the Great Edinburgh Fire of November 1824.

He died at 227 High Street in Edinburgh and was buried at the north-west corner of Greyfriars Kirkyard. The British Museum has extensive holdings of his works, including two albums apparently assembled by Kay.",":

With a paper label stating ‘Harrods Limited Furniture Depository, Barnes, S.W.13. Sir E J Venner, D/No. 485 22/4/55’. English, circa 1800.

Provenance: Sir E.J. Venner

Footnote: John Grant, 75 Fleet Street, London, was apprenticed to his uncle Alexander Cumming. He was appointed honorary freeman of the Clockmaker’s Company in 1781 and was Warden by the time he died in 1810. There are numerous examples of his work in the Guildhall Museum, London. His son, also John Grant, continued the business until 1852, holding the position of Master five times between 1833-67.

Sir John Franklyn Venner (1902-55) was officially listed, during the war, as a group captain in the Auxiliary Air Force. He had, in fact, been the financial director of the Special Operations Executive from 1940. It is noted by Christopher J Murphy in Neville Wylie (ed.) The Politics and Strategy of Clandestine War-Special Operations Executive 1940-1946, p.196, that by 1942 he was in direct control of the total expenditure of the SOE and by Michael Richard Daniell Foot, in SOE: An Outline History of the Special Operations Executive 1940-1946, p.360, that “Venner left a name with those who knew him of wizardry bordering on genius: as witness the fact that when he cast up his final accounts, he showed a profit of £23m”. He was knighted in additional recognition of his huge contribution to the war effort.",0

Vol. 2, Greece and Rome. Published by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY, 1987. With introduction by Joan R. Mertens. The art created in Greece during the fifth century B.C. established the standards to which all Western art has aspired well into our own times. Indeed, the word ""classical,"" when used either specifically or figuratively, usually refers to those ideals of beauty and proportion developed on the Greek mainland more than four hundred years before the birth of Christ. Copied by the Romans, who revered the art of their Greek subjects, and ""rediscovered"" during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in what came to be known as a ""renaissance"" or rebirth of classical culture, the works bequeathed us by the Greeks—or in many instances by their Roman imitators—still influence the art we make and the ideals by which we judge it. Although the art of the ancient Greeks may be said to have reached its apogee in Athens in the fifth century B.C., it had, in fact, been developing for at least four thousand years. The Greeks settled and traded over a wide area, and eventually, under Alexander the Great, they moved into the Near East as conquerors. Thus they were able to assimilate and transform the art of many indigenous cultures. Once the Romans subjugated Greece, they, too, embarked on their own process of assimilation and transformation, on the one hand faithfully copying Greek art, and on the other, subtly transforming that art into one that more appropriately served first, republican taste, and later, imperial needs.

The old world sword features a double edge blade with two griffins and intricate motifs on both sides. The hilt showcases a detailed guard, a handle with the goddess Athena on one side and the demigod Hercules on the other, the pommel displays a replica of a coin with the infamous Alexander the great. The decorative weapon is in excellent condition commensurate with age and use, and has a rich polished steel and gilt finish. The decorative heavy sword would make a stylish, and fun addition to a man's study, office or game room.
The xiphos is a double-edged, one-handed Iron Age straight shortsword used by the ancient Greeks. It was a secondary battlefield weapon for the Greek armies after the dory or javelin. The classic blade was generally about (18–24 in).

(1) & (2) – PRESENTING AN EXCEPTIONALLY RARE and FULLY AUTHENTIC Theodore Roosevelt Letter from August 1918 with original envelope.

On ‘Sagamore Hill’ letterhead. Fully handwritten and personally signed by President Theodore Roosevelt.

Dated August 14th 1918.

With it’s original envelope, stamp and postage marks.

What makes this letter so important is the author, the office and the content.

It is addressed to Eliza Calvert Hall (C/O L.C. Obenchain) who was a well known author at the end of the 19th Century and Early 20th Century. In 1905, Theodore referred to her book “Aunt Jane of Kentucky’, in a Presidential Speech and recommended that every man in America should read it to understand ‘the plight of their womenfolk’.

He regularly corresponded with her and we have a number of those letters in our collection. It appears that both he and Edith became big fans of Mrs Calvert Hall/Obenchain who was also heavily involved in the Suffragist movement.

The letters also provide a fascinating and historic record of Roosevelt’s personal beliefs and feelings on female empowerment.

This letter reveals Teddy’s desire to meet the author in New York and have her visit Sagamore Hill.

The letter is a folded double folio with writing on the outside only.

The Letter Reads:
Sagamore Hill
Aug 14th, 1918
“Dear “Eliza Calvert Hall”;
I don’t even know whether you are married ! Yet we feel as if we know you very well. We dearly love the poem. Do you ever get to New York ? We so wish we could see you out here at our house.
Always yours,
Theodore Roosevelt“
The envelope is addressed to: Miss Eliza Calvert Hall, L.C. Obenchain, 6004 Bryan Parkway, Dallas, Texas

It is stamped on the front as posted from Oyster Bay, New York Post Office on August 14th 1918.

It has a purple 3 Cent ‘George Washington’ Postal Stamp.

(3) & (4) – PRESENTING AN EXCEPTIONALLY RARE & HIGHLY IMPORTANT and FULLY AUTHENTIC Theodore Roosevelt Letter from November 1918 with original envelope.

The Letter is on ‘The Kansas Star’ letterhead. Typed and personally signed and hand amended by Theodore Roosevelt.

With it’s original Kansas City Star envelope, stamp and postage marks.

Dated November 8th 1918.

What makes this letter so important is the content!

It refers to the recent death of Teddy’s youngest son, Quentin who died in combat in France in WW1 (July 1918) and the pain and mourning, of both he and Edith.

Historians and experts on Teddy, will tell you, that he did not like to talk about Quentin in public, as it was too painful and hurtful for him. Correspondence in which he does talk about Quentin are VERY, VERY RARE and are the MOST PRIZED items of Theodore Roosevelt’s Memorabilia.

Quentin’s death was a great personal loss to his father, who realized quite well that he had encouraged his son’s entry into the War. He never fully recovered from Quentin’s death and, within six months, was dead himself.

After Quentin’s grave came under Allied control, thousands of American soldiers visited it to pay their respects. It became something of a shrine and an inspiration to his comrades in arms.

The fact that he was being so ‘open’ to Lida, a mere 4 months after Quentin’s death, just shows the friendship that they had built between them, over a number of years.

It is ‘eerie’, also, that within 2 months of this letter and poem, he himself was dead.

It is addressed to Mrs Obenchain (AKA – Eliza Calvert Hall Obenchain) who was a well known author at the end of the 19th Century and Early 20th Century. In 1905, Teddy referred to her book “Aunt Jane of Kentucky’, in a speech and recommended that every man in America should read it to understand ‘the plight of their womenfolk’. 
He regularly corresponded with her and we have a number of those letters in our collection. It appears that both he and Edith became big fans of Mrs Obenchain, who was not just a famous author but was also heavily involved in the Suffragist movement. 
Teddy had spent years trying to arrange a visit from her as is referred to in various letters in the Collection. Some of the other correspondence in the Collection (including telegrams) suggest that they did in fact, finally meet, in person, but we do not know when, but judging by the content of this letter it would have been just before Teddy passed, namely in the last 2 months of his life. 

The various letters in the Collection also provide a fascinating and historic record of Roosevelt’s personal beliefs and feelings on female empowerment.

The Letter Reads:
“The Kansas City Star

The Office of Theodore Roosevelt

New York Office

347 Madison Avenue

November 8th, 1918

My dear Mrs. Obenchain,

Last July soon after Quentin’s death I took Mrs Roosevelt to spend three weeks with our daughter and her two babies on the Maine coast. (I need not tell you that the babies help a sore heart very much). The immense mass of correspondence that came in was answered by various kinsfolk – it was not possible on account of the mass for us to deal with it personally, not to mention the fact that we were away. But there were some people who ought to have been answered personally, and you were one. You do not need to be told how Mrs. Roosevelt and I believe in you, how we admire your writings, and believe in you and your whole family. This is just a belated line of acknowledgment.

Faithfully yours,

Theodore Roosevelt

Mrs. M.A. Obenchain,

Ogden College,

Bowling Green, Ky.“

The envelope is From: The Kansas City Star, New York Office, 347 Madison Avenue.

Addressed to: Mrs. M.A. Obenchain, Ogden College, Bowling Green, Ky but redirected to 10004 Bryan Park, Dallas, Texas.

Note: This was a spelling mistake and should have been Mrs. W.A. Obenchain …. this was quite common for Teddy in his later years, as he regularly made mistakes in people’s names, as is evident from various other letters by him that have appeared on the market or in museum collections.

It is stamped on the front as posted from New York Post Office at Grand Central on Nov. 13 1918.

It has a purple 3 Cent ‘George Washington’ Postal Stamp.

On the rear of the envelope is a stamp from Bowling Green, KY Post Office dated Nov 15 1918.

Obviously, the Bowling Green Post Office forwarded the letter to Mrs Obenchain who had now re-located to Dallas Texas.

The reference(s) by Teddy to ""l need not tell you"" and ""babies"" .... refers to Lida's loss of her husband (Major William Alexander Obenchain) in August 1916 and her subsequent move to Dallas from Bowling Green, to be with her children and grandchildren and in particular, to care for her daughter Margery, who had contracted tuberculosis.

(5) BUT WAIT! JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT COULD NOT GET ANY BETTER … WE PRESENT A unique and important hand-written poem/note on an index card, which was contained in the original envelope of the Roosevelt Letter of August 1918 (above).

At first, we did not realize it’s significance and thought that it was merely a handwritten note or written memo by Eliza Calvert Hall.

Having dealt with hundreds of items in her estate, she would regularly write notes on index cards, which she would insert into books she possessed. She also wrote notes on the sides of letters, etc.

Then we thought that ‘maybe, just maybe’, it was a poem she wrote for Roosevelt, especially as she was an author and poet, BUT, surely, if she had written it for Teddy, then she would have sent it to him?

AND if she had sent it to him, then why would he have sent it back to her?

Also, using an index card as a means to pay tribute to such an important figure as Teddy and his son, would not make sense .... it is 'way' too informal?

SO, we decided to take a 'MUCH CLOSER LOOK' at it and the entire Collection AND having deciphered the content of the card and performing hand writing comparisons (and getting a 'tad' prematurely excited at one point, that it may have in fact, been written by Teddy himself .... in our defense ... their respective handwriting styles were very similar! LOL), we are now 100% satisfied that it is the 'hand' of Lida. 

Then we remembered the letter from Teddy to her of August 1918 (only a month after the death of Quentin) in which he says: ""We dearly love the poem"".

EUREKA .... THIS IS THE POEM!

This was Lida's 'ORIGINAL DRAFT' of the finished poem that she sent to Teddy and she kept it with the August Letter.

The 'Finished Poem' was sent by her, to The Roosevelts on August 10 1918 and the original envelope and 2 page poem, are with the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site and can be viewed on the Theodore Roosevelt Center Digital Library. 
We attach pictures from the Roosevelt Center Library of the original finished poem sent to Teddy and it's envelope.

Lida had obviously placed the draft poem with the August 1918 envelope, which is where we found it.

It is written in pencil, on both sides of the index card and when we read and deciphered the CONTENT we were BLOWN AWAY!

The Poem reads:
“Time was we wept and thrilled o'er ancient tombs.

And sought for finest language to Extol.

The English Abbey’s spirit haunted aisles.

Or jeweled splendors of the Taj Mahal.

They sleep watched by two staples

Sentinels.

But here are noble graves. O Part paused.

Sing your best songs and stress the laurel’s leaf.

They sleep, watched by the sleepless sentinels.

Immortal Glory & Immortal Grief

“

A soldiers grave, carelessly roughly made.

The bare brown earth, no marble white expanse

Wild meadow flowers (pause) trampled grass

and then

The wooden cross that say:

“He died for France”

TO FIND THE 'ORIGINAL DRAFT' OF THE POEM, BY THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR, (THE SOURCE OF POETIC INSPIRATION) THAT WAS THEN FINALISED BY HER AND SENT TO THE ROOSEVELT'S, 

AND THE ONLY KNOWN COPY HELD WITH THE ROOSEVELT CENTER LIBRARY, 

IS QUITE SIMPLY A STUNNING & IMPORTANT DISCOVERY!

This is an outstanding piece of writing/poetry, by a well known author and poet of the day, much admired by the Roosevelt's and a noted figure in the late 19th and early 20C Women's Suffrage Movement.

Eliza (Lida) Calvert Hall Obenchain, personally sent this to Teddy & Edith in August 1918, expressing her personal condolences, by way of tribute to Quentin (who had only passed away less than a month previous), in poetic form. 

This was a DEEPLY PERSONAL 'TOUCH' by her and much appreciated by the Roosevelt's, as evidenced by the August letter.

The Poem that was sent to the Roosevelt's, is headed ""Quentin Roosevelt"" and signed by ""Eliza Calvert Hall"".

We knew that the November Letter was very valuable (on it's own) because of the mention by Theodore of Quentin's death and his and Edith's personal pain and grief BUT when you have a collection of 6 ORIGINAL & FULLY AUTHENTIC items that complete a FULL story/picture of The Roosevelt's pain, grief and mourning, after Quentin's death, composed in the short few months thereafter and the imminent passing of Teddy himself looming, THEN, all this, just sends the value of this Collection, into the stratosphere!!!

Similar single typed letters, personally signed by Theodore, which reference Quentin's death, have sold at Auction - Heritage & Christies for between $60,000 and $85,000. But NONE of those come close to this Collection and in particular the personal and unique revealing content!

THIS COLLECTION SHOULD REALLY BE IN A MUSEUM ..

AND MAYBE THAT IS WHERE IT WILL END UP .... 

BUT, IF YOU ARE A PRIVATE COLLECTOR OF 'ROOSEVELT MEMORABILIA', 

THEN THIS IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY!

(6) PRESENTING AN EXCEPTIONALLY RARE and FULLY AUTHENTIC Office of Theodore Roosevelt Letter from September 1918 to Major LC Obenchain.

The ‘timing’ of the November letter to Lida Calvert Hall Obenchain, is further made relevant by, a luncheon Roosevelt had with Lida’s son, Major L.C. (Alex) Obenchain at Sagamore on Monday the 16th September 1918.

This luncheon is confirmed in this letter from The Office of Theodore Roosevelt and The Kansas City Star dated 12th September 1918 addressed to “Major L.C. Obenchain, 6004 Bryan Parkway, Dallas, TX – 387th Field Artillery, Camp Mills, N.Y.” Signed by Roosevelt’s Secretary and confirming the luncheon date.

Major L.C. Obenchain (also known as ‘Alex”) 1888-1938, was Lida’s eldest son who served in the 387th Field Artillery and saw action in WW1.

It is not difficult to deduce, that Roosevelt’s meeting with Alex (a WW1 Veteran), brought up memories of ‘Quentin’ and led to Roosevelt writing the letter to Lida in November.

THE LETTER READS:

“September 12, 1918

My dear Major Obenchain,

Colonel Roosevelt would be very glad if you could come to Sagamore Hill next Monday for lunch at 1 o’clock.

Sincerely yours,

??????

Secretary

Major L.C. Obenchain,

6004 Bryan Parkway,

Dallas, TX

327th Field Artillery,

Camp Mills, N.Y.”

In an interesting ‘twist’ ….. (L.C.) Alex came to a very ‘unfortunate end’, in that, his body was found on Dec 2, 1938, 8 miles below Alexandria, LA, in a thicket near the bank of the Red River. According to the The Town Talk (Alexandria, LA newspaper), cause of death was determined to be death from a .38 caliber bullet to the head. It was ruled a murder by the coroner’s jury and was never solved.

Provenance: From the Eliza Calvert Hall Estate. Never seen outside of the family … until now!

Condition: Very Good. Some discoloration (yellowing of paper) through passage of time. Some staining on the front of Nov envelope. No tears to November letter. Some minor tears to September letter. Aug envelope has a tear across the front. None of these minor defects adversely affect the pieces. All 6 items are kept in an acid free plastic pouch.",": Nov Envelope is 6.5 inches wide and 3.65 inches tall

The November Letter is: 8.5 inches wide and 11.2 inches tall.

(1) ORIGINAL and FULLY AUTHENTIC Confederate Field Map of Richmond, VA 1864 belonging to Capt W.A. Obenchain C.S. Engineers,

(2) ORIGINAL and FULLY AUTHENTIC Surrender/Parole Paper for Capt. W.A. Obenchain dated 1st May 1865 at Greensboro, NC

(3) ORIGINAL and FULLY AUTHENTIC Pamphlet for Hillsborough Military Academy, NC with Major W.M. A. Obenchain listed as 'Military Staff'.

These ALL belonged to Captain (later promoted to rank of Major) William Alexander Obenchain and the battlefield map was his 'personal' field map for the Battle of the Richmond Peninsula in 1864, at the end of the US Civil War.

It is a very large map, measuring 40.2 in (W) x 36.75 in (H) fully unfolded, but when folded, is a neat and portable/compact 6.5 in (H) x 5.25 in (W) 0.75 in (D).

It is a printed paper map, mounted on canvas.

It is HEADED:

” Chief Engineers Office D.N.V

Maj. Gen. J.F. Gilmer Chief Engineer.

Map of

the Vicinity of Richmond

and part of the

Peninsula

from surveys made

under the direction of A.H. Campbell, Capt. P.E.C.S.A.

In charge Topograph(l) Dep(t) D.N.V.

1864

Scale 1/50000 (?)

Photographed in Off. Top. Dep.

D.N.V.”

Hand noted as:

“Approved April 26th 1864

Albert H. Campbell

Capt P. Engrs in charge”

What makes this Map EXTRAORDINARY is:

(1) It is a VERY, VERY RARE example of a Confederate Field Map that was actually printed. Nearly ALL other Confederate Maps were simply hand drawn.

(2) It is the personal Map of Capt. William Alexander Obenchain who was the Head of the Virginia Corps of Engineers and served on General Robert E. Lee’s Staff. His has personally signed it on the front of the folded canvas “Vicinity of Richmond, VA – Wm A. Obenchain, Capt C.S. Engineers, 1864”. We know that this is his signature and hand-writing, from comparison with other signatures of his, that we have in a large book collection from his Estate.

(3) Richmond was the ‘Capital’ of the Confederacy and hugely symbolic and of strategic importance.

(4) Following their defeat at Petersburg, the Confederate government had left the city of Richmond, fleeing to Danville. The Army of Northern Virginia finally surrendered on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox Court House. The war would last a few weeks longer as other Confederate armies surrendered. The fall of Richmond signaled the end of the Confederacy.

(5) This map not only deals with the surrounding area of Richmond, but most of the Peninsula, including Petersburg and the Appomattox River in the bottom left. It is incredible in it’s detail of topography, roadways, supply lines, rivers, etc. The coloring appears to be hand colored.

(6) This map reflects the high status/position of it’s owner, AND.

(7) Would have been used in battle/combat by Capt. Obenchain during the Richmond Campaign in 1864, during a pivotal moment in the conclusion of the War.

As added provenance (and added value and bonus) , we are selling this map together with the original surrender/parole paper of Capt. W.A. Obenchain, who surrendered to General WT Sherman at Greensboro, NC on 1st May 1865.

The Surrender/Parole Paper reads:

“Greensboro, North Carolina

May 1st 1865

In accordance with the terms of the Military Convention, entered into on the twenty sixth day of April, 1865, between General Joseph E. Johnston, Commanding the Confederate Army, and Major General W.T. Sherman, Commanding the United States Army in North-Carolina,

Wm. A. Obenchain, Capt C.S. Engineers

Has given his solemn obligation not to take up arms against the Government of the United States until properly re-leased from this obligation; and is permitted to return to his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authorities so long as he observe this obligation and obey the laws in force where he may reside.

M Keartruff (?) Jno. Johnson (?)

G…. (?) Brig Gen ADA, USA Maj & Actg Chief Eng C.S.A.

Special Commissioner Commanding”

Attached to that surrender paper is another bonus, namely, an extremely rare and original pamphlet for the Hillsborough Military Academy from circa 1866, where the ‘now Major’, W.A. Obenchain is part of the Academic Staff.

This Collection has remained in family ownership until now and has never been released to the general public …. UNTIL NOW!

In an interesting ‘twist’, we have an autograph of General William Tecumseh Sherman (listed/posted separately in this category) marked as owned by Mrs Obenchain, who was in fact, Eliza Calvert Hall (a renowned author from Bowling Green, KY) who was married to Major William Alexander Obenchain, who surrendered to General Sherman at Greensboro, North Carolina on the 1st May 1865.

THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO OWN A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF US HISTORY!
THESE PIECES SHOULD REALLY BE IN A MUSEUM!

The cover inset with a simulated hard stone cameo of Ceres in profile to the right within a circular ormolu frame, flanked by scrolling green acanthus issuing pink anthemion and blue flower heads, the side-panels with garlands of flowers on a gilt-ground, the casket with an embossed hand chiseled ormolu frame enclosing four flared rectangular pale-lilac-ground panels with similar decoration centered by trophies, mounted with ormolu double-scroll foliage handles cast with a winged lion mask, supported on four paw feet, the interior fitted with original silk lining and chenille trimming,
circa 1815-1820

This Paris porcelain ormolu-mounted casket encapsulates the lavish refinements of the Empire period. It was most probably given to a high-ranking lady as a gift on the occasion of her marriage, or perhaps after the birth of a child. The cover is inset with a Fine simulated hardstone cameo of Ceres, the Greek goddess of agriculture who was emblematic of fertility and plenty, making this casket a fitting and symbolic gift. The casket is closely related to a smaller workbox with similar ormolu mounts and cameo decoration now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The V&A example is inscribed ‘Feuillet Rue de la paix 18’ to the underside of the cover and has a contemporary Feuillet paper label to the underside. Although the present casket is considerably larger in size and finer in quality, its similarity to the V&A workbox suggests that it was assembled by Feuillet.

Jean-Pierre Feuillet (1777-1840) was a leading Parisian decorator and retailer who set up a shop in Paris on the rue de la Paix under the protection of the prince de Condé. Feuillet gained a reputation as one of the best porcelain decorators in the city and he used porcelain blanks from a variety of Parisian manufacturers including Nast and Darte Frères, supplying many aristocratic collectors. The porcelain panels used in the present casket would probably have been supplied as blanks to Feuillet, and subsequently decorated and mounted in ormolu by Feuillet, as is the case with the example in the V&A. The V&A workbox was bequeathed by Mrs. T.R.P. Hole in memory of Bettine, Lady Abingdon, and was once part of a large collection of French Empire decorative arts owned by Charles Stuart, Lord Stuart de Rothesay (1779–1845) who was the British Ambassador in France during the Napoleonic wars. It seems likely that the present casket was also intended for a similarly important collector.

The painting of trompe l’oeil cameos in imitation of hardstone cameos became a popular but technically challenging decorative technique used by many of the leading Continental porcelain factories in the late 18th and early 19th century. The technique was first used at the Sèvres manufactory in the late 18th century, but it was only truly mastered under the directorship of Alexandre Brongniart in the early 19th century. Brongniart’s training as a mineralogist could well have influenced the refinement of the technique at Sèvres. Cameos had a particular appeal to Napoleon, and he ordered vases and services painted with them, including two services called Service ‘Icongraphique’ from Sèvres painted by the artist Degault with figures from antiquity. Cameos were well adapted for Imperial propaganda, lending an antique authenticity but also alluding to the cultured fashion for classicism. Designs for such cameos were taken from Ennino-Quirino Visconti’s, Iconographie grecque, published by order of Napoleon in Paris in 1808. Visconti (1751-1818) was an Italian antiquarian and art historian, papal Prefect of Antiquities, and an expert on ancient Roman sculpture. Copies of his three volume work were given out as gifts and disseminated through Sèvres and other Parisian factories and it seems very likely that the artist who painted the Ceres cameo seen here drew inspiration from Visconti’s publication. 

Because of the technical difficulties presented by painting cameos, Feuillet most probably turned to one of the best independent decorators to supply the central cameo panel for this casket. The two most celebrated decorators specialising in this technique were Jean-Marie Degault and Louis-Bertin Parant. Of the two, Parant was the leading artist in cameo decoration; although he was employed by Sèvres to work on important commissions he was not part of the regular workforce, preferring to work independently in his own studio in Paris, decorating both Sèvres and other porcelains. Brongniart was continually frustrated at the slow progress of Parant, who was a perfectionist and had gone to great lengths to find Authentic Models for his cameo portraits. Parant’s slow progress was to benefit other accomplished artists, including Jean-Marie Degault who gained further commissions from Sèvres as a result. It is not known whether Degault worked exclusively for Sèvres, or whether he also worked as an independent decorator, but the pair of Sèvres vases ‘fuseau’ decorated by Degault and now in the Twinight Collection, New York, show a similar subtle depth of detail to each of the Emperor’s laurel crowns and the style of the calligraphy of the inscription is also close to that seen on the cameo on the present casket.",0

St. Petersburg, circa 1820.

This rare and elegant marquetry games table, or Lomberian, is representative of the golden age of Russian craftsmanship of the early nineteenth century. The table, in keeping with courtly pursuits of the day, has a triple turn-over top, opening successively to reveal a chess board and a leather playing surface for cards. 

The upper surface is veneered with exceptional marquetry inlay in stained sycamore, holly, boxwood, and Russian native timbers. It is centred by an oval roundel with a decorative and highly unusual still-life tableau of playing cards and dice. 

The distinctive form of the decorative marquetry inlay and the use of rich indigenous timbers confirm the Russian origin of this table. The flowering tendrils being a distinctive feature of the work of a small group of St Petersburg cabinet makers such as Nikifor Vasilyev and Matvei Veretennikov. Both of these master cabinet makers were serfs, Veretennikov belonging to Count Alexander Vasilievich Soltikov and Vassilyev belonging to the Sheremetev estate. It is interesting to note, that of the small number of known masterpieces by these makers, two of them are elaborately inlaid gaming tables, confirming its importance as a furniture type amongst the Upper Classes of the period. 
 
A late 18th century marquetry gaming table by Veretennikov now resides at the Moscow Museum of Russian History, and a marquetry inlaid games table, of related form to the present example, by Nikifor Vasilyev, can be found in the Standard Room of the Peterhof Palace.",":

This is one of the most incredible and spectacular displays of Meissen Porcelain we have had the pleasure of having in our collection of over 50,000 individual items. The piece is so incredibly large, that it had to be manufactured in three separate pieces. In the Rococo taste, the monumental urn is intricately decorated in an abundance of multi-colored truly realistic porcelain flowers, vines and leaves, rocaille décor, and delightful cherubs and nymphs perfecting the Autumn aesthetic. Atop the urn is a gorgeous finial in the form of a beautiful maiden in a pink floral designed dress holding a bouquet of wheat, the quintessential autumn plant, with a wheat crown atop her head. Scattered throughout the urn are wheat plants, apples, pears, and other summer fruits and vegetables. An exuberant amount of expertise went into making this urn, which is demonstrated through the highly complex and truly outstanding quality of the piece. Pieces like this are extremely rare to find, and even more rare to find in this condition. Underneath are blue crossed swords mark and pressnumer.

These throne chairs played a crucial role in the conception of kingship for all Indian Maharajah's during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the Indian culture, silver is seen as a purifying and sacred metal. In the Indian scripture, it is mentioned that silver is the most dignifying metal to be used for thrones of rulers. This marvellous silver throne is beautifully overlaid, embossed, repousséd, and engraved with exquisite designs. The throne and its original foot-stool still have their original cream-colored silk upholstery. This throne is especially rare, in that all the detail of the fauna and flora are meticulously done in open-work hand-carved filigree. The throne is hand-carved with marvellous craftsmanship into the gorgeous flowing vines and flowers seen throughout. On either side of each handle are a pair of beautifully hand-carved silver seated lions, representing power, prestige and eternity.

Italy, Circa: 19th/20th century

Provenance: From an Important Palm Beach Collection

The first Murano glass chandeliers started production in the early 18th century. Venetian glass had been produced since the early 13th century and was renowned as the most beautiful and purest glass in the world. The glassmakers of Murano had always excelled at making beautiful and original works of art, and the transfer of their skill to chandelier production instantly bought a new dimension to the possibilities of chandelier design. Following a fall in production after the occupation of the Venetian republic by the armies of Napoleon from 1797, the mid-19th century saw a revival of Murano glass production when Venetian glass became intensely popular again.",0

The ornately carved drop-front cassone with an allegorical in-relief carvings depicting playful Putti among satyrs, fruits and acorns, centered with a carved winged lion holding a shield, flanked on each side by pull-out drawer compartments, each with carvings of a single Putto.

Circa: Florence, 1880-1890. 

A cassone (plural cassoni) or marriage chest is a rich and showy Italian type of chest, which may be inlaid or carved, prepared with gesso ground then painted and gilded. Pastiglia was decoration in low relief carved or moulded in gesso, and was very widely used. The cassone (""large chest"") was one of the trophy furnishings of rich merchants and aristocrats in Italian culture, from the Late Middle Ages onward. The cassone was the most important piece of furniture of that time. It was given to a bride and placed in the bridal suite. It would be given to the bride during the wedding, and it was the bride's parents' contribution to the wedding.

There are in fact a variety of different terms used in contemporary records for chests, and the attempts by modern scholars to distinguish between them remain speculative, and all decorated chests are today usually called cassoni, which was probably not the case at the time. For example, a forziere probably denoted a decorated chest with a lock.

Since a cassone contained the personal goods of the bride, it was a natural vehicle for painted decoration commemorating the marriage in heraldry and, when figural painted panels began to be included in the decor from the early quattrocento, flattering allegory. The side panels offered a flat surface for a suitable painting, with subjects drawn from courtly romance or, much less often, religious subjects. By the 15th century subjects from classical mythology or history became the most popular. Great Florentine artists of the 15th century were called upon to decorate cassoni, though as Vasari complains, by his time in the 16th century, artists thought such work beneath them. Some Tuscan artists in Siena and Florence specialized in such cassone panels, which were preserved as autonomous works of art by 19th century collectors and dealers, who sometimes discarded the cassone itself. From the late 1850s, neo-Renaissance cassoni were confected for dealers like William Blundell Spence, Stefano Bardini or Elia Volpi in order to present surviving cassone panels to clients in a more ""authentic"" and glamorous presentation.

A typical place for such a cassone was in a chamber at the foot of a bed that was enclosed in curtains. Such a situation is a familiar setting for depictions of the Annunciation or the Visitation of St. Anne to the Virgin Mary. A cassone was largely immovable. In a culture where chairs were reserved for important personages, often pillows scattered upon the floor of a chamber provided informal seating, and a cassone could provide both a backrest and a table surface. The symbolic ""humility"" that modern scholars read into Annunciations where the Virgin sits reading upon the floor, perhaps underestimates this familiar mode of seating. 

At the end of the 15th century, a new classicising style arose, and early Renaissance cassoni of central and northern Italy were carved and partly gilded, and given classical décor, with panels flanked by fluted corner pilasters, under friezes and cornices, or with sculptural panels in high or low relief. Some early to mid-sixteenth-century cassoni drew their inspiration from Roman sarcophagi (illustration, right). By the mid-sixteenth century Giorgio Vasari could remark on the old-fashioned cassoni with painted scenes, examples of which could be seen in the palazzi of Florentine families.

A cassone that has been provided with a high panelled back and sometimes a footrest, for both hieratic and practical reasons, becomes a cassapanca (""chest-bench""). Cassapanche were immovably fixed in the main public room of a palazzo, the sala or salone. They were part of the immobili (""unmoveables""), perhaps even more than the removable glazed window casements, and might be left in place, even if the palazzo passed to another family. 

A similar Cassone, most likely by the same Florentine cabinetmaker, was acquired in Florence in the 1880's by Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, the younger brother of the Emperor Alexander III of Russia. The Cassone is currently on display in the Vladimir Palace (the former official residence of GD Vladimir Alexandrovich) in St.Petersburg, Russia. An image of the Cassone at The Vladimir Palace is available upon request.

Italian Marble Bust of The Grandparents, Titled: Rimembranze, Signed Vichi. 
 Presenting an exquisite Italian masterpiece from the 1800s, we have a captivating white Carrara marble bust group entitled ""Rimembranze"" (Remembrance). This remarkable sculpture portrays an endearing elderly couple locked in a tender embrace, their love emanating through the gentle touch of the man's hand on the lady's chin and face. The profound affection and mesmerizing connection between them are beautifully captured in the expressions gracing their faces.

Renowned for his exceptional talent, Ferdinando Vichi meticulously crafted this sculpture, paying meticulous attention to every detail. The couple's wrinkles, veins, and musculature, as well as the delicate rendering of their clothing and expressions, are expertly brought to life by Vichi's craftsmanship, establishing this artwork as one of his most remarkable and meticulously executed pieces. The sculpture rests on a contrasting black marble base with the title ""Rimembranze"" etched into the side, further enhancing its aesthetic appeal.

Vichi's artistry is truly captivating. The old woman's knitted shawl, meticulously fashioned out of marble, appears astonishingly lifelike, while the choice of beautiful white marble exudes a refreshing allure. The old man's playful gesture of touching the lady's chin is captured with natural grace and warmth. Vichi's exceptional ability to sculpt fabric with such finesse creates an illusion of softness that defies the medium of marble itself. The remarkable attention to detail, from the intricately carved wrinkles and smile lines to the depiction of a lifetime shared in joy, evokes a profound sense of admiration.

Ferdinando Vichi, a member of the esteemed Florentine School and associated with the Bazzanti Gallery in Florence, Italy, was part of a talented group of Tuscan sculptors. His body of work encompasses a wide range of subjects, including romantic busts, orientalist themes, and Renaissance-inspired models. Similar to his contemporaries from the late nineteenth century, Vichi often drew inspiration from romantic and tender subjects. This is exemplified in the beautifully detailed marble group depicting an elderly man's playful courtship and deep love for his wife.

This 19th-century Italian marble group titled ""Rimembranze"" is signed by the esteemed artist Ferdinando Vichi, who was associated with the renowned Pietro Barzanti gallery. Vichi's versatility extended to working with both marble and alabaster, and his repertoire included subjects ranging from the Antique to allegorical themes and Orientalism. In 1898, Vichi made a significant contribution to the memorial erected in the cathedral of Santa Croce to honor the composer Gioacchino Rossini.",0

Provenance

Expressionist Abstract painting in oil on canvas. Original untouched condition. From the studio of the artist. 

Jacoba van Heemskerck 1876-1923 was a Dutch avant-garde painter, stained glass designer and graphic artist. She attended classes at the Royal Academy of Art in the Netherlands and in Paris with Eugene Carriere. She worked with avant garde painters such as Piet Mondriaan and the German Expressionists Franz Marc, Kandinsky and Jawlensky. Heemskerck developed a style of abstract symbolism with compositions of pictorial space, black contours and intensive use of color. Her style was eventually so abstract that her subjects became unrecognizable. Her art can be found at the National Gallery of Art, the MoMa New York and museums in Brussels, Paris, Berlin and the United States.

The painting is in found condition and untouched. It is unsigned and unframed. 

Provenance: From the Estate of the collector and philanthropist, Henry Alexander Count of Salm-Hoogstraeten, Tuxedo Park, New York.

This impressive Japanese porcelain jardiniere, hailing from the Meiji period around 1880, is a testament to the enduring allure of blue and white ceramics. A masterwork of size and craftsmanship, this jardiniere bears witness to the remarkable fusion of traditional Japanese aesthetics and symbolism.

Adorning the upper section of the jardiniere, just below the rim, is a decorative band adorned with stylized scrolls and delicate floral motifs. This ornate band pays homage to the broad rim that gracefully encircles the jardiniere's upper portion, decorated in a similar manner, accentuating the piece's cohesiveness and attention to detail.

Set against a background of white porcelain, the jardiniere's bulbous body serves as a canvas for a translucent blue and white dynamic pattern that envelops the entirety of the main bowl. Within this tapestry, a lively and delightfully expressive pack of Shishi dogs playfully interacts with wine barrels. Originating from Chinese mythology, the Shishi was embraced by Okinawans in the 15th century as protectors against malevolent spirits and misfortune. In this jardiniere, they partake in a lively play with wine barrels, symbolizing abundance and prosperity, infusing the composition with a touch of whimsy. 

Surrounding the Shishi Dogs are luxuriant, oversized peonies, stylized scrolls, and circular lattice work, creating a scene teeming with vitality and charm. The nuanced shades of translucent blue, ranging from delicate pastels to deep cobalts, imbue the artwork with depth and tonality. Notably, the peonies are brought to life through subtle gradations and intricate detailing, achieving a level of realism that is truly remarkable. The lower base of the jardiniere features a repeating pattern, depicting stylized mountain peaks. 

This jardiniere represents a harmonious union of Japanese artistry and mythology, serving as a testament to the superb craftsmanship of the Meiji period. Its fusion of cultural influences, celebration of natural beauty, and intricate design make it a treasure.",0

This is such a rare find ….. You will not find these anywhere else …. Truly historic!
It contains the very first edition ever printed!

John Bull is a national personification of the United Kingdom in general and England in particular, especially in political cartoons and similar graphic works. He is usually depicted as a stout, middle-aged, country dwelling, jolly, matter-of-fact man.

John Bull originated in the creation of Dr. John Arbuthnot, a friend of Jonathan Swift (author of Gulliver’s Travels) and satirist Alexander Pope in 1712, and was popularized first by British print makers. Arbuthnot created Bull in his pamphlet Law is a Bottomless Pit (1712). The same year Arbuthnot published a four-part political narrative The History of John Bull. In this satirical treatment of the War of the Spanish Succession a bold, honest and forthright clothier John Bull brings a lawsuit against various figures intended to represent the kings of France and Spain as well as institutions both foreign and domestic.

Originally derided, William Hogarth and other British writers made Bull “a heroic archetype of the freeborn Englishman.” Later, the figure of Bull was disseminated overseas by illustrators and writers such as American cartoonist Thomas Nast and Irish writer George Bernard Shaw, author of John Bull’s Other Island.

Starting in the 1760s, Bull was portrayed as an Anglo-Saxon country dweller. He was almost always depicted in a buff-colored waistcoat and a simple frock coat (in the past Navy blue, but more recently with the Union Jack colors). Britannia, or a lion, is sometimes used as an alternative in some editorial cartoons.

As a literary figure, John Bull is well-intentioned, frustrated, full of common sense, and entirely of native country stock. Unlike Uncle Sam later, he is not a figure of authority but rather a yeoman who prefers his small beer and domestic peace, possessed of neither patriarchal power nor heroic defiance. Arbuthnot provided him with a sister named Peg (Scotland), and a traditional adversary in Louis Baboon (the House of Bourbon in France). Peg continued in pictorial art beyond the 18th century, but the other figures associated with the original tableau dropped away. John Bull himself continued to frequently appear as a national symbol in posters and cartoons as late as World War I.

The original John Bull was a Sunday newspaper established in the City, London EC4, by Theodore Hook in 1820 ……… This collection contains the original of the very first edition!!!!!

It was a popular periodical that continued in production through July 1892.

Artist statement:
The artist as an observer decided after many years of visiting non-western places of culture to put his
memories to use on visible surfaces for people to see. He continued his search for an arena where he
could get an artistic experience. In the following years he had traveled down many roads getting ideas
from countries which followed non-western traditions. After ten years of painting in New York, Alexander
Gore moved to Miami, where he opened his own gallery. The hot southern palette has had a cheerful
effect on his paintings, which have been nurtured by sun, epitaph and happiness of life. Invigorated by the
energy of being in Miami he produced more than 6,000 original works that found a home in art
collections all over the country and around the world. “In my art,” Alexander Gore says, “I try to convey
the organic movement of colors across the canvas by using a strong line that hints all the shapes to come.”
Gore’s works give a picture of black lines, curvy characters and intricate touches, creating an atmosphere
for the imagination to fill. The great changes, of light and shade prompted him to paint weightless forms
unknown to nature; he unlocked a vital energy and creative spirit. Gore’s style of art reflects a powerful
surrealistic influence and incorporates countless travel experiences. He works in abstract and semi abstract forms, weightless in time and space. His art portrays an alternative view of reality, one without
borders and limitations. Alexander’s paintings, which are original and made with oil on canvas or paper,
are immediately recognized by the dominant lines, twisted shapes and subtle colors. He has created a new
style of art he calls “Agorism,” a style based on principle and motivated by surrealistic image. While
Alexander Gore’s art has been shown in museums, galleries and auction houses globally, he has gained
most renown along the East Coast, appearing in Washing DC, New York and Miami. “Imaginary forms
are a huge part of human fantasizing that is the primary activity of a human. Visualizing and acting on it
is a creative activity of an artist. All important ideas in our culture found a base in the past and the
collective imagery of today produce all the archetypes in the western world. Images are always voices of
inner self and to record is a moment of artistic ability.”",0

Rome, Circa: 1850

Giovanni Paolo Panini (Piacenza 1691-1765 Rome), View of Saint Peter's Square, Rome.
From Christie's Auction:
Giovanni Paolo Panini arrived in Rome in 1711, painting capricci and architectural pieces in a vigorous if slightly eccentric style, and by 1719, when he was admitted to the Academy of St. Luke and the virtuosi al Pantheon, he was a rising star in the Roman art world. From around 1719-1726 he was much in demand for decorative frescoes, including quadratura, ornament and landscape and other genres, often in collaboration with figure or flower painters. During this period he worked for Cardinal Patrizi at Villa Patrizi, Cardinal Annibale Albani at Palazzo Albani (now del Drago) alle Quattro Fontane, Livio de Carolis at Palazzo de Carolis, Cardinal Alberoni at Palazzo Alberoni, Innocent XIII Conti in the Quirinal and in the library of S. Croce in Gerusalemme. In 1724 he married Caterina Gosset, the sister-in-law of Nicolas Vleughels, the director of the French Academy in Rome, to which he was admitted in 1732, and as a result he was much patronized by the French. During the 1720s he developed his figure style away from the awkwardness of his early works into one that concentrated on groups of stylishly-dressed aristocrats and skillfully modelled bystanders, sibyls and pseudo-antique figures. These he noted down in drawings (such as a sketchbook in the British Museum) that he drew upon to populate his paintings. He also began to receive commissions to design and record temporary festivals, often for French ambassadors to Rome.

By the beginning of the 1730s Panini was developing a distinctive subgenre of the capriccio in which recognizable monuments are placed in imaginary topographical relationships, which were well-received in the classicizing era of Clement XII Corsini. In 1732 he was one of the panel of judges for the competition instituted by Clement for the Lateran façade, and in the following year painted an impressive View of Piazza del Quirinale for the pope. At about this time he was developing his best-known topographical subjects, interior views of St Peter's and the Pantheon, which were much in demand, to judge by the number of extant versions extending into the 1750s. By about 1734 he was beginning to attract the attention of English patrons, who ordered sets of Roman views, such as those at Marble Hill House (1738) and Castle Howard. In 1736, through Filippo Juvarra, he received important commissions from Philip V of Spain for scenes of the life of Christ in the Chinoiserie room at La Granja in Spain (1736). From as early as the 1720s he had been producing some vedute (view-paintings), initially based on prototypes by Gaspar van Wittel, and he developed the genre in subsequent decades in works that would include impressive panoramic views of the Forum or Palatine, although his staple genre was the capriccio rather than the veduta. He also expanded his repertory of church interiors, adding such churches as S. Paolo fuori le Mura and S. Agnese in Piazza Navona, as well as church interiors recording special events. His son by his first marriage, Giuseppe (1718-1805), began to support him in architectural and festival design projects.

By the 1740s Panini was at the peak of his powers, and evidently had a considerable workshop helping him meet demand, especially of capricci to be used as overdoors and other decorative installations. Giovanni Paolo was successful in elevating himself socially above the usual artisanal status of genre painters, and would sometimes include a self-portrait in paintings commissioned by the great and powerful. He also appears to have been successful financially, and owned a substantial palazzo in via Monserrato. He increasingly concentrated on important commissions, such as a view of the Lottery in Piazza Montecitorio (London, National Gallery, 1743-1744), the designs for the festival decorations for the birth of the Dauphin in Palazzo Farnese (Waddesdon Manor, 1751), or the view of an imaginary picture gallery housing the collection of Cardinal Valenti Gonzaga (Wadsworth Atheneum, 1749). In the mid-1750s he received an important series of commissions from the Duc de Choiseul, French ambassador to Rome and soon to become one of the most powerful men in France, that included his best-known compositions, Ancient Rome (Roma Antica) and Modern Rome (Roma Moderna). These large paintings, of which there are three sets (in Boston and Stuttgart, the Metropolitan Museum, and the Louvre) represent imaginary picture galleries based on the Valenti Gonzaga composition but hung with what purport to be Panini's own vedute of ancient and modern sites respectively (with corresponding pieces of sculpture). These paintings sum up the eighteenth-century canon of the greatest works of architecture and sculpture, and the equivalence between modern and ancient Rome. By this time Panini was being assisted by his son by his second marriage, Francesco (1748-1800), who was a skilled draughtsman and painter who continued his father's work after his death in 1765.

The Farnborough Hall paintings

The Piazza S. Pietro and the Campidoglio are important vedute by Panini painted in 1750 and originally installed, with other works by Panini and Canaletto, in the seat of the Holbech family, Farnborough Hall, Warwickshire (National Trust). Farnborough Hall had been inherited in 1717 by William Holbech (circa 1699-1771), who is documented on the Grand Tour in Florence, Rome and Venice from late 1732 until his return home at the end of April 1734 with his brother Hugh. Holbech is said to have gone on the Grand Tour to recover from a broken heart and to have spent a considerable time there prior to these documented appearances. During his time in Rome he acquired two Paninis, which were seen by an anonymous antiquary around 1746, who referred to various sculptures ""all brought from Rome with two pictures, one of the Rotunda, and the other of diverse buildings by Panino"" (British Library, Add. MS 6230, pp. 31-32). The Rotunda (the Pantheon) is a painting now in a private collection in New York, and is signed and dated 1734. The Diverse Buildings, which was probably one of Panini's capricci, has not been identified. On his Grand Tour Holbech seems also to have acquired two Canalettos, although they are not mentioned by the antiquary, who may only have had eyes for things Roman.

In about 1746-1747, Holbech remodelled the house by creating a Saloon, now the dining room, at the back of the house. This room, the entrance hall, the staircase, library and closet were stuccoed by William Perritt of York, and a bill for this work dated 14 November 1750 survives (or survived until recently; G. Beard, Decorative Plasterwork in Great Britain, London, 1975, p. 233). The two Canalettos acquired on the Grand Tour were installed in the Saloon, together with two new works commissioned from Canaletto, who was then in England and working nearby at Warwick Castle in 1748. The two Paninis acquired on the Grand Tour may have been installed in the Library, as Alastair Laing assumes (op. cit.), while three new works commissioned from Panini in Rome were placed in the Hall and Saloon: the Piazza S. Pietro for the overmantel in the Hall (fig. 1), the Campidoglio as the overmantel in the Saloon (fig. 2), and an Interior of St Peter's (now in Detroit) (fig. 3) on the adjacent wall facing the windows. Two of the Canalettos flanked the Campidoglio, while the others were on the opposite wall. The Interior of St Peter's was therefore effectively the fifth member of the Canaletto set, distinct from the two overmantels.

Holbech's installation of his Canalettos and Paninis in fixed stucco frames was unusual for England in 1750, and had probably been inspired by what he had seen on his Grand Tour in Northern Italy, where fixed stucco installations of canvases were common in the 1720s and 1730s (Cornforth, II, p. 51). The Campidoglio and the Interior of St Peter's are both signed and dated 1750, a date that corresponds to the payments for the stucco.

The commission for the new Paninis would have been made through an agent, possibly the Roman dealer in antiquities Belisario Amidei from whom some of the antique busts in the Hall were acquired in 1745, who was also a picture dealer; or perhaps the painter Pietro Berton, who on 7 December 1750 shipped a Panini to England.

The paintings were sold to Savile Gallery in 1929 and replaced by copies by one Mohammed Ayoub. The four Canalettos were exhibited at Savile Gallery in 1930 and entered the London art trade, finding their way at various times to Augsburg, Melbourne, Ottawa and a private collection. The Paninis seem to have been resold immediately to Knoedler & Co. in New York. When the stucco was removed from the library by Holbech's great-grandson, another William Holbech, shortly after his succession in 1812, the Interior of the Pantheon and the Diverse Buildings may have been taken down. Although there is no record of either painting being at Farnborough subsequently, the Interior of the Pantheon at least must have remained there, since it appeared at Knoedler's in 1930 at about the same time as the other Paninis, and was presumably acquired at the same time from the same source.

The Campidoglio was a rare subject for Panini: this is the only known extant version, apart from fictive versions in the Metropolitan Museum (1757) (figs. 4) and Louvre (1759) versions of his Roma Moderna composition (but not in the first Boston version of 1757). Probably Holbech insisted on the choice of subject in order to represent the centre of Rome's civic administration to complement the religious one of St Peter's. The Campidoglio may have been of interest to English patrons because it represented the seat of a form of government they were more comfortable with than the papacy. For example, Canaletto painted the subject, together with English subjects, for Thomas Hollis, 'the most bigoted of all Republicans' in 1755, who may have wanted to 'represent London as the heir to the legacy of Ancient Rome and Renaissance Italy' (see Michael Liversidge and Jane Farrington, eds., Canaletto and England, exhibition catalogue, Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery, London, 1993, p. 25). Canaletto also painted the subject for Sir Richard Neave, Ist Baronet (1731-1814) of Dagnam Park, Essex, at the end of his English stay or shortly afterwards (i.e. 1755-1766) (sold, Sotheby's, London, 10 July 2002, lot 8). Like Holbech, Neave mixed Venetian and Roman subjects, but his Roman subjects steer clear of St Peter's: the others were the Piazza del Quirinale and Piazza Navona. While Holbech had gone to both Venice and Rome and commissioned views of both cities, Rome sets the keynote for his decoration: antique busts line the Hall, and its religious and civic centres are the overmantels in the Hall and Saloon respectively.

The Piazza S. Pietro

The Piazza S. Pietro shows the piazza much as it appears today, apart from the absence of Valadier's late eighteenth-century clocks on the towers. Bernini's colonnade (1656-1667), both ends of which are visible, reaches out its arms to embrace the viewer. In the center of the piazza is the obelisk moved by Sixtus V in 1586 from the left side of the church where it had formed part of the Circus of Nero. On either side are two fountains, the one on the right by Carlo Maderno (1613) and the one on the left created to match it by Carlo Fontana in 1677. Beyond is the rectangular forecourt to the church, the piazza retta, leading to the façade by Maderno, completed in 1610, and the dome by Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana. To the right of the façade the roof of the Sistine Chapel is just visible, followed by the Cortile di S. Damaso, the palace of the Swiss Guards and the palace of Paul V. A Cardinal is being driven in a carriage across the piazza at the right in the direction of the Borgo Nuovo and Ponte S. Angelo with his blue-liveried retinue and subsidiary carriages. Unlike the later versions of the subject that depict the Duke de Choiseul, there seems to be no intent to portray any particular cardinal: the procession of a cardinal here is presented simply as characteristic activity within the piazza. Various groups of figures, including well-dressed women in brightly colored dresses, Swiss Guards, priests, gentlemen, idlers and a pilgrim are distributed around the piazza. In the foreground an imaginary heap of fallen masonry provides visual interest in an otherwise dead space.

Panini painted the Piazza S. Pietro on a number of occasions, and his works falls into two types, one with the viewpoint shifted slightly to left of the axis, as in the Farnborough Hall version, and one with it shifted slightly to the right. The first type is based on a composition by Gaspar van Wittel, of which there are numerous versions from 1684 until 1721 (Fig. 9 van Wittel). The work by Panini that seems closest to Van Wittel and therefore probably the earliest is the version in the Circolo della Caccia, Rome, which has been dated to the second half of the 1730s, but is probably a decade or so earlier. Another, on the London art market in 2002-2009, and a version with workshop participation at Sotheby's, Milan (20 November 2007, lot 137) and currently on the art market in Rome, are closer to an important painting in Toledo (Arisi no. 308) that is signed and dated 1741 (fig. 6).

Van Wittel employed a wide format (about 2:1), showed both of the end faces of the colonnade almost to their full extent, and introduced the theme of a heap of masonry to enliven the foreground. His choice of perspective implies a viewpoint located in the small piazza between the Borgo Nuovo and Borgo Vecchio, now the Piazza Pio XII at the top of the Via della Conciliazione. From this viewpoint a building at the left tended to interfere with the view of the end of the left arm, as can be seen from the Nolli map of 1748 (fig. 7) and Piranesi's etching of circa 1646-1648 where, in contrast to the Van Wittel-Panini tradition, the obelisk and center of the façade of St. Peter's are aligned (fig. 8). This is why in Van Wittel's paintings and in the Paninis closest to them there is a glimpse of the building on the corner of the Borgo Vecchio on the left. Another detail found in Van Wittel and the associated Paninis, including the Farnborough Hall picture, is what seems to be four bollards protecting a drain to the right of the right-hand fountain. In Van Wittel's painting, however, there is a drinking trough for horses nearby, which by Panini's day had been relocated to the small piazza between the Borgo Nuovo and Borgo Vecchio as can be seen in the Nolli map.

The Toledo picture shows Panini attempting to adapt the wide Van Wittel format to a less elongated format by extending the foreground and sky and cropping the left side, a process extended further in the Farnborough Hall version, where the field is almost square (as was presumably specified by Holbech and the stuccatore Perritt). As if recognizing the limits of adapting the Van Wittel composition to squarer formats, in 1754 Panini developed the second type with the viewpoint shifted to the right, which has the effect of bringing the end of the right arm of the colonnade under the palace of Paul V and creating a more dynamic composition. Nonetheless, he reverted to the first type for the large painting in the Duke of Sutherland collection (circa 1756-1757, Arisi no. 472) and in the fictive canvas in the three versions of the Roma Moderna composition.

The Campidoglio

The Campidoglio shows, from the right, the Palazzo dei Conservatori (no. 919 on Nolli's 1748 map, fig. 9), remodelled by Michelangelo from 1538, the Palazzo del Senatore (Nolli 920), remodelled by Michelangelo at the same time, and the Palazzo Nuovo (Nolli 918), completed to Michelangelo's design in the 1650s and 1660s. Between the Palazzo Senatorio and Palazzo Nuovo is a glimpse of the dome of Pietro da Cortona's SS. Luca e Martina. In the center of the piazza is the statue of Marcus Aurelius, installed there in 1538, with the surviving traces of its gilding emphasized to help it compete for attention with the colossal statues of the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux) with their horses on the balustrade. These came from the Temple of Castor and Pollux beside the Circus Flaminius and had been dug up in about 1560 and installed on the balustrade in 1585 and 1590, together with the statues of trophies known as the Trofei di Mario (Trophies of Marius) from a triumphal arch of Domitian that had been reused for the Nymphaeum of Alexander Severus. On either side are two statues found on the Quirinal in 1635, Constantine the Great on the left and his son Constantine II on the right. At the ends of the balustrades are two milestones from the via Appia, the one on the left marking the seventh mile and the one on the right marking the first. Between the Dioscuri rises the cordonata, a pedestrian and horse ramp linking the Piazza d'Aracoeli to the Campidoglio, flanked at the bottom by two fountains created in 1587-1588 from two Egyptian crouching lions in black granite from the Temple of Isis in the Campo Marzio.

Canaletto based his views of the Campidoglio closely on Alessandro Specchi's engraving of 1692 (fig. 10), and Panini does so as well, which may seem surprising, since he, unlike Canaletto, was on the spot, but it was generally easier for vedutisti to start from an existing engraving if there was one. That Specchi was the source for both artists is demonstrated by the way the carriage ramp on the right, which did exist, is mirrored by one on the left, which did not. The right-hand ramp was remodelled in this form during the reign of Innocent XII (1691-1700) by Filippo Tittoni (1645-1713), who preceded Specchi as architetto del Popolo Romano (architect to the 'Roman People', i.e., the Campidoglio). The previous ramp was straight and clearly presented a problem for carriages which had to turn at ninety degrees at the bottom against the side of the cordonata, a problem eased by curving the mouth of the ramp. The ramp on the left, however, could never have been built without demolishing much of the staircase of S. Maria in Aracoeli, so Specchi presumably introduced it as a way of idealizing an image that glorified the Campidoglio and cleaned up what would have been an awkward junction with the steps of the Aracoeli staircase. The executed right-hand ramp was known as the Via dei Tre Pile, 'pile' being Romanesco dialect for the pots of the Pignatelli coat of arms that appear on top of the pedestal ornaments at the beginning of the ramp.

At the bottom right Panini shows a building that corresponds to the Ospizio de' Geronimi di S. Alessio (Nolli 983), which is also shown by Specchi and in Vasi's 1754 engraving. It has banded pilasters, an arched doorway, two stringcourses and an attic window below a low tiled roof. One difference is the fact that the pilasters in Panini are double, whereas those in Specchi and Vasi are single. This is probably an aesthetic choice by Panini: in his Charles III visiting Benedict XIV in the Quirinal Caffeaus (Arisi, no. 368) he also doubles the pilasters of Ferdindano Fuga's Caffeaus in an otherwise factual representation. Attached to this building is a short section of wall enclosing a small garden, and there is space between this wall and the parapet wall of the Campidoglio. According to Specchi and Vasi there was no such space, as is confirmed by Nolli's map of 1748. These details must be Panini's invention, prompted by the awkward junction of building and ramp.

On the façade of the Palazzo Senatorio, Panini depicts round disks bearing coats-of-arms on either side of the central bay of the Palazzo Senatorio. These do not appear in any other eighteenth-century representations, including Specchi, Vasi and Piranesi's near-contemporary view (1746-1748), but similar armorial disks are found in a drawing by Lievin Cruyl of 1665 (engraved in editions published in 1666 and 1689). Evidently such coats-of-arms were placed there on occasion, and the fact that Panini chose to show them may indicate a desire to heighten the ceremonial significance of the building; they also provide useful color accents. However, the framing surrounding the inscription above the central doorway bears only a casual relationship to the actual framing, suggesting he was interpreting the hints given by Specchi in his own architectural style.

Although Panini's point of departure was Specchi's print, he redrew the composition in a perspective better suited to his own purpose, as was customary for view-painters. He shifted the Palazzo Senatorio almost to the center of the composition, lowered the horizon line from the level of the top of the steps of the Palazzo Senatorio to the bottom, and shifted the vanishing point a little to the left. He reduced the foreshortening on the Palazzo Nuovo, but probably by more than he should have: having placed the horizon at ground level it was easy to make such adjustments without being too strict in the perspective construction. This shift in vanishing point should not have had the effect of making the cordonata converge in a fanlike way from left and right, rather than from the left as in Specchi, and Panini seems to have made this change to create a more energetic composition, where the three main components -- cordonata, Palazzo Nuovo and Palazzo dei Conservatori -- all converge steeply toward the scenographic backdrop of the Palazzo Senatorio. This is combined with a subtle asymmetry emphasized by the shifted positions of the Dioscuri relative to the Palazzo Senatorio, and the glimpse of the above-mentioned building at the right.

As a result of these changes, the cordonata becomes the main field of interest, allowing Panini to distribute across it his characteristic repertory of (underscaled) figures. Panini has in fact reconfigured the cordonata as a kind of Scalinata di Spagna (Spanish Steps), which he would represent a few years later in 1756-1758 in a drawing in the Metropolitan Museum. The cordonata was in reality never so broad, nor so suitable a space for social interaction: it was and is primarily the means for getting from the Piazza di Aracoeli to the Piazza del Campidoglio.",0

This terracotta sculpture is a representation of the 1868 work by French sculptor Albert Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, titled Offering to Bacchus (Offrande à Bacchus).  Bacchus is the Roman deity associated with wine, agriculture, indulgence, and fertility. He supported the arts, theater, and human leisure, and held major significance to pagan worshippers during the growing season. 

In this scene, a devout woman makes an offering to Bacchus—happily disembodied while sitting on the branches of a tree. He is adorned by a crown of grapes, signifying his godly power and the earthly realm he watches over.  For the harvest to be plentiful, Bacchus would accept offerings from his human devotees. Pleased by a multitude of intoxicants, Bacchus happily accepts the offering from the young woman whose motives are unknown. Perhaps the small child next to her hints at her desire for fertility.

The pendulum takes the form of a sun.   During the 18th century, French furniture production took inspiration primarily from the palace at Versailles, where Louis XVI polarized the ornate neoclassical style. Neoclassical clocks are classically excessive and indicative of the immense wealth of the French ruling class.  There is a sense of French imperial power imbued within this clock, as the figure that stands atop the circular face looks to be a triumphant soldier, dressed in Roman gladiator attire. Similarly, the sun-shaped pendulum nods to Louis XIV’s reign as the “Sun King.”   Imperial power was conveyed in lavishly decorated home furnishings—consolidating political and economic capital in quotidian household items.

Old bird print depicting two gilded flickers. This print originates from 'The new and heretofore unfigured species of the birds of North America', published 1866-1869.

This spectacular large folio lithograph is from Daniel Giraud Elliot's The New and Heretofore Unfigured Species of the Birds of North America. The work was published in New York for the author between 1866 and 1869. Each lithograph features original hand-coloring. The plates were predmoninantly executed by Bowen of Philadelphia after originals by Elliot and celebrated natural history artist, Joseph Wolf. It is believed only 200 copies of this work were ever printed. 

The work generally depicted life-size renderings of birds that were not previously illustrated by Alexander Wilson or John James Audubon. It had a particular focus on birds of the American West including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. It also depicts some birds from the Alaskand and Arctic regions. Many of birds were drawn from birds brought back from government-led expeditions in the West as well as private sources including John Xantus de Vesey. 

Elliot’s lithographs are some of the most valuable American bird plates. Elliot was a prominent American zoologist. He was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the American Ornithologists’ Union. Elliot was also curator of zoology at Chicago’s Field Museum. 

In the preface, Elliot describes his intentions for the work: ""Since the time of Wilson and Audubon, no work has been published upon American Ornithology, containing life-size representations of the various species that have been discovered since the labors of those great men were finished. The valuable productions of Cassin, as well as the revised edition of the ninth volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, the joint labor of Messrs. Baird, Cassin and Lawrence had indeed appeared . but no attempt had been made to continue the works of the first great American naturalists in a similar manner . It was, therefore, with the desire to contribute . towards the elucidation of the comparatively little known species of the Birds of North America, their habits and economy, as well as to render their forms familiar so far as life-size representation of them might serve to do, that I undertook the present publication.""

This pair of candelabra are set on Verde Antico marble base with ormolu mounts held up by gorgeous winged lions. The ormolu arms and bases have been finely cast and hand-chiseled with exceptional detail and meticulous craftsmanship. Each candle holder is being held up by intricately hand-chiseled dragon majestically holding their heads up towards the candles. Between the four arms are three flaming phoenixes upholding the final candlestick.  Found on the patinated bronze are beautifully placed acanthus leaves flowing upward to the top of the candles. The ormolu is of the finest quality with the doré bronze exceptionally handcrafted and the patina prodigiously hand-painted on.

This pair of candelabra was made in France in the early 1800s and is attributed to the work of the Parisian guilder and modeler Claude Galle. Galle had been one of the main figures at the International Exhibition in Paris in 1819 and is one of the most important casters and gilders of the 18th century and the early 1800's.",0

According to an article posted by the MET Museum, rustic rootwood chairs such as these were meant to suggest Buddhist and Daoist figure’s lack of attachment to earthly luxuries. Instead of depicting deities and important religious icons on sumptuous thrones, rootwood chairs signified the relationship between humans and nature.  Each chair is hand-carved from the finest rootwood and further lacquered creating a rich dark color on the exterior of the wood.  The seating areas are finished with comfortable white cushions and they are ready to be used in any decor.  A similarly designed rootwood table was sold in Christie's Auction for more than $68,000.

Paintings dating back to the eleventh-century show figures perched in chairs made of roots and other unwieldy natural materials. During the Ming dynasty, elite members of society began to commission furniture that looked to be made of tree roots, and historical records show rootwood furnishings exhibited at the Purification Ceremony Pavilion in the Forbidden City of Qianlong.

Old bird print depicting Cassin's Snow Goose. This print originates from 'The new and heretofore unfigured species of the birds of North America', published 1866-1869. 

This spectacular large folio lithograph is from Daniel Giraud Elliot's The New and Heretofore Unfigured Species of the Birds of North America. The work was published in New York for the author between 1866 and 1869. Each lithograph features original hand-coloring. The plates were predmoninantly executed by Bowen of Philadelphia after originals by Elliot and celebrated natural history artist, Joseph Wolf. It is believed only 200 copies of this work were ever printed. 

The work generally depicted life-size renderings of birds that were not previously illustrated by Alexander Wilson or John James Audubon. It had a particular focus on birds of the American West including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. It also depicts some birds from the Alaskand and Arctic regions. Many of birds were drawn from birds brought back from government-led expeditions in the West as well as private sources including John Xantus de Vesey. 

Elliot’s lithographs are some of the most valuable American bird plates. Elliot was a prominent American zoologist. He was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the American Ornithologists’ Union. Elliot was also curator of zoology at Chicago’s Field Museum. 

In the preface, Elliot describes his intentions for the work: ""Since the time of Wilson and Audubon, no work has been published upon American Ornithology, containing life-size representations of the various species that have been discovered since the labors of those great men were finished. The valuable productions of Cassin, as well as the revised edition of the ninth volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, the joint labor of Messrs. Baird, Cassin and Lawrence had indeed appeared . but no attempt had been made to continue the works of the first great American naturalists in a similar manner . It was, therefore, with the desire to contribute . towards the elucidation of the comparatively little known species of the Birds of North America, their habits and economy, as well as to render their forms familiar so far as life-size representation of them might serve to do, that I undertook the present publication.""

Joseph-Théodore Deck was born in 1823 in Guebwiller in Alsace. He dreamed to become a sculptor but his humble origins oriented him towards a more prosaic profession: ceramic potter. He learned the technique of ceramics as a manufacturer of covered ovens with ceramic tiles and traveled to Germany, Hungary and Austria to improve his skills. At the age of 24, he moved to Paris to practice his art and worked in a factory that made ceramic kilns. He opened his own earthenware workshop in 1856 with his brother and his nephew and specialized in the oriental style and more particularly in the Iznik style. In the 1880s he explored the Chinese tradition and collaborated with Raphaël Collin, an academic painter professor at the Academy of Fine Arts recognized for the links he forged between French art and Japanese art both in painting. and ceramic. He published a treatise on the art of earthenware in 1887.He died in Paris in 1891.
Deck's contemporary sculptors and painters made frequent visits to the Deck workshop, which thus became an experimental laboratory to promote ceramics as an art and no longer simply as an industrial application. It was while attending the National Porcelain Museum in Sèvres that Deck studied Islamic art. Deck discovered that the brilliance of oriental ceramics was due to an alkaline base containing tin oxide. The decorations are covered with a transparent coating which produces a shiny and translucent effect. After many trials and experiments, Deck succeeded in perfecting this technique and created Deck Blue, his famous turquoise-blue using potash, soda ash and chalk. Deck presented his first collection of louvered earthenware at the Paris Exhibition of 1861 but it was at the London Exhibition of 1862 that he was officially recognized as an artist when the Victoria and Albert Museum bought three of his works. . He received a silver medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1867. Deck copied many Iznik ceramics but also created his own variations around the oriental theme by assembling various patterns on a single work.",0

Provenance

Supplied to Lieutenant-General Alexander Graham-Stirling (1769-1849) for Rednock House in Stirling, Scotland and thence by descent until sold in 2004

This table, recorded in the dining room in an inventory and valuation of the furniture at Rednock House completed in March of 1926, was probably supplied in around 1827. The Graham-Stirling papers contain several estimates for furniture prepared by the Scottish firms Alladice and Sclanders and Thomas Auchie and it is quite possible that this wonderful table was supplied by one or other of the two firms. Unfortunately there are no surviving records that relate to the production of this particular piece so this must remain a matter of speculation at this stage.",0

About Donegal Rugs
Antique Donegal rugs are a distinctive type of hand-knotted carpet that originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the Donegal region of Ireland. These rugs are renowned for their high quality, unique designs, and vibrant colors. 

The production of Donegal rugs began in the 1890s, initiated by Scottish textile manufacturer Alexander Morton. Morton was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, which emphasized traditional craftsmanship and natural materials. Morton established a weaving workshop in Killybegs, County Donegal. The workshop employed local weavers, many of whom were women, and focused on producing high-quality, hand-knotted rugs.

Donegal rugs often feature intricate patterns inspired by Celtic art, nature, and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Common motifs include stylized flowers, leaves, and geometric shapes. These rugs are known for their rich and vibrant colors, achieved through the use of natural dyes. Traditional colors include deep reds, blues, greens, and golds. High-quality wool is typically used, contributing to the durability and luxurious feel of the rugs. The wool was often sourced locally from Irish sheep.

Donegal rugs are hand-knotted, with a high knot density that enhances their durability and detail. The weaving techniques are similar to those used in traditional Persian rug-making. The meticulous craftsmanship and use of fine materials result in rugs that are not only beautiful but also long-lasting.

Like other antique textiles, Donegal rugs require careful maintenance. Professional cleaning is recommended to preserve their colors and structural integrity. Avoiding direct sunlight, excessive moisture, and heavy foot traffic can help maintain the condition of these antique pieces.

Antique Donegal rugs are highly sought after by collectors and interior designers due to their historical significance, beauty, and rarity. Donegal rugs remain a testament to the skill and artistry of Irish weavers, and their continued appreciation highlights their enduring appeal and historical importance.

The colorful ""Chasse a Courre"" tapestry (chasing, hunting with hounds), was created in Belgium, circa 1800. The antique “tapisserie de Bruxelles” features an outdoor hunting scene with hunters in ceremonial clothing along with horses, a dog pack and deer. The scene is embellished in the background with tree and foliage decor. In the foreground, four horsemen in classic, Baroque Louis XV uniforms carry hunting horns around their necks and try to contain a pack of hounds ready for action. In the background, running horses and dogs are chasing a deer in front of them. The fine tapestry is in excellent condition with vibrant colors throughout and its original border. The piece also has a canvas backing for stability, and would make a lively, rustic addition to a large wall in your home or ranch.
Brussels tapestry workshops produced tapestry from at least the 15th century, but the city's early production in the Late Gothic International Style was eclipsed by the more prominent tapestry-weaving workshops based in Arras and Tournai.
When Louis XIV minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert organized the royal manufactory of the Gobelins, an early suite was The Acts of the Apostles first woven at Brussels. The Brussels workshops soon fell under the influence of French design originating from the royally supported Gobelins, to the extent that the story of Alexander suite, a thinly disguised allegory trumpeting the ascendancy of Louis XIV, were woven also at Brussels, among other places. Brussels received an influx of highly trained workers when the Gobelins was temporarily closed in 1694 and the weavers ordered to disperse, under the financial stringency of Louis XIV wars.
The 18th century saw the increased competition of the French workshops, both royal and private. Weavers like Le Clerc, Leyniers, van den Hecke and de Vos maintained quality, but the last of the traditional Brussels tapestry ateliers closed at the time of the French Revolution, by which time tapestry was finally becoming less popular; Goya's designs for the royal factory in Spain were perhaps the last major works in the medium.

The porcelain was made in China between the late 1700s and early 1800s. The porcelain was then sent to France in the 19th century where the doré bronze mounts were applied. All the doré bronze mounts are superbly cast and hand-chased with exceptional detail. The handles of the vase are the most striking in appearance. The top of each handle starts with a scrolling design which leads into a dolphin face. The dolphins are connected to one another with beautiful vine-like garlands. The vases are held-up by two acanthus leaf bases with circular garland mounts. The fine quality of the Ormolu mounts of these vases, the hand chasing, and the fine gilt doré gold is easily attributable to Escalier de Crystal of Paris. They were known for mounting fine early Chinese ceramics in the 1800s. Truly a magnificent pair of vases, they can easily be turned into a fine pair of lamps.

A Fine pair of Japanese Ginbari cloisonne vases , Meiji period (1868-1912), worked with a silver wire and decorated with a pagoda with landscape of mt. Fuji, river and trees reserved against an emerald green and silver ginbari ground. 

The ginbari technique (similar to guilloche enamel) involves flooding transparent enamel over a patterned metal surface. This creates a shiny mirror like effect, along with clearly preserving the pattern of the underlying metal.

Size: 9 cm, one vase is smaller then other for 5 mm.

In late 1739-early 1740 the Sèvres Porcelain factory opened in the Royal Château of Vincennes, 16 years later in 1756 the factory moved to the village of Sèvres located outside of Paris and in route to Louis XV's Palace of Versailles where it became the preeminent porcelain manufacturer in Europe. When the company ran into financial difficulties, the King who had become an avid client bought out the shareholders and became the sole owner. The factory remained in the royal family until it was nationalized following the French Revolution. 

The range of objects produced in the first half of the 19th century was enormous, as were the types of decoration that they employed. The Sèvres factory produced ninety-two new designs for vases. The factory is still in production today.",0

This pair made at the Imperial Glass Workshop, under the Sponsorship of the Imperial Family would have been at home in a Paris drawing room as easily as in St. Petersburg.

The Intense Ruby Red color of the Crystal is created by adding large quantities of gold to the molten glass before the object is created. The resulting color is dense yet full of light just like its namesake the precious jewel. The Dore bronze mounts use motifs taken from antiquity. Likewise, the shape of the handles is inspired by Greco-Roman amphora.

The Facets of the Diamond Chevron patterned decorations capture and manipulate the light and the fluting repeated on the base adds to the overall sense of light made light made solid.",0

Sevres is a commune southwest of Paris that is known for its porcelain production. Manufacture nationale de Sèvres is a premier European porcelain factory that has been in Sevres since 1756. From 1800-1847, Alexander Brongniart was the director of the factory. Trained as both an engineer and a scientist, Brongniart brought about many changes to the factory, such as improving the composition of hard-paste porcelain and developing enameled colors to simulate marble.

Our marbled blue Sèvres porcelain vase is a fantastic decorative element that can be placed on a variety of tables or in a niche. It can also be used as a planter for a small floral arrangement.",0

Behold, this magnificent 19th century Bohemian Red Crystal Gilt Ewer is a true masterpiece of antique artistry. As you gaze upon this stunning piece, you will be immediately drawn to the intricate design of twisting and turning grape leaves, grapes, and vines with tendrils that have been expertly painted in a multi-toned partly translucent 24k Gold.

The gilding lends a naturalistic appearance to the leaves, with shading and highlights, covering almost the entire surface of the ewer but allowing ribbons of red crystal to peek through, creating a stunning contrast that is both breathtaking and mesmerizing.

The lovely swooping handle of the ewer curves down to banded gilding that highlights the waist, giving it an elegant and sophisticated look as it sits atop of the wonderfully plump lower section of the ewer, creating a sense of balance and harmony that is both pleasing to the eye and soothing to the soul.

As you continue to marvel at the beauty of this antique piece, you will be enchanted by the base of the ewer, which fans out and has solid gilding that helps to frame the ewer nicely, balancing it perfectly with the waistline, beautifully curved spout, and handle. The result is a truly magnificent work of art that is both stunningly beautiful and exquisitely crafted.

This museum quality antique is a rare and precious treasure that is sure to capture the hearts and imaginations of all who are fortunate enough to behold it. It is a testament to the skill and creativity of the artisans who crafted it, and a reminder of the enduring beauty of antique artistry. In excellent condition, circa 1870, Bohemian.",0

Paul Canaux was an incredible jeweler and silversmith, and would produce his pieces in 30 rue des Francs-Bourgeois in Paris. He originally worked for the great silversmith and plater Joseph Mégemond. Following his career with Mégemond on August 9th, 1888 he placed his own hallmark. He was a made an array of products, which included silverware, cutlery, tea sets, centerpieces, candelabras as well as many other silver and gilt-bronze objects of the highest quality. His maker’s hallmark was struck in 1892 and they changed the name to ""Paul Canaux et Cie"". In the 5 Generations of our business, these are some of the greatest candelabras we have ever had the pleasure of adding to our collection.
This is truly an exceptional pair of candelabras. They were produced by P. Canaux, a master silversmith who made the most wonderful and outstanding pieces of silver and ormolu. These ormolu candelabras are no exception with a variety of hand-chased and hand-chiseled motifs which elevate these pieces to a different level of quality and craftsmanship. The top most finial of each candelabra is absolutely marvelous with a phoenix emerging from a cauldron of flames. Flanked on either end of each candelabra are two satyrs each holding up a candelabra arm with superior quality, each wrinkle in their faces and hair on their heads is visible. Between the candelabras is a basket of ormolu cast fruits, leaves, and vines. They are truly breathtaking and in high-relief against the main body of the candelabras. The other two candelabra arms are held up by Nereus, the Greek GD of the sea. He is known for his half-man, half-dolphin appearance with a majestic and highly detailed pair of angelic wings. Running down the rest of the candelabra pillar bodies are lions masks with garlands hanging from their mouths and a fantastic rounded base with acanthus leaf decoration and four lions-paw feet holding them up. The bottoms of each are signed, ""P CANAUX ORFEVRE PARIS"".

Decorated with a multitude of deer and birds amongst a meadow with flowering branches growing from rocks and mountains on a turquoise ground. The attention to detail is immaculate with each deer being a different color harmoniously living with one another within the peace of the wilderness. The mountains are all beautiful with variable sizes demonstrating the differences between the depth of each mountain in the plane of view. Flying around the area are beautiful cranes, which symbolize longevity and peace. The entire landscape is a symbol of peace, prosperity, and nobility. Around the borders are flying bats each of a different color and style, yet another symbol of health, long life, prosperity, love of virtue, and a tranquility.

These are truly a gorgeous pair of lamps, with hand-carved and hand-polished smoky rock crystal bodies, each carved out of a single large piece of naturally smoky rock crystal. The quality of these particular smoky rock crystal bodies is equivalent to a fine quality diamond; the clarity and light smoky color are very rare to find, as these smoky rock crystals are usually very dark, murky, and of poor quality. Finding a pair of smoky rock crystal lamps of this size and shape is very difficult as these rocks were hand-selected, hand-carved, and finally hand-polished to enhance their fantastic color and very large size. The smoky color of these crystals is rarer than clear crystal and they go delightfully in any décor and any style home. They are both Mid-Century Modern as well as Louis XVI style, making them a perfect addition to a bedroom, den, living room, etc. They are both electrified and ready to be used.
France, Circa: 20th century

The height of the piece can be adjusted. The total height is 27 inches, while the actual piece, to the top of the gilt wood is 15 inches.",0

As was Chippeway Indian custom, she has selected from his minimal wardrobe, a suit of his best and most colorful clothes to carry around with her where ever she goes during her mourning period. She will take it in a colorful blanket with her to work and to sleep, and treat it with dignity and respect in honor of her husband's memory, for a minimum of one year, during which time she may not marry. 

A wonderful article of Americana, this lithograph was made by McKenny and Hall and is dated 1837. It was published by E.C. Biddle in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and is one of the many Indians (approximately 120) that are portrayed in the major work, ""History of The Indian Tribes of North America, Volumes 1-3"" by Thomas McKenny and James Hall (from the Library of Congress).

 Along with Catlin's ""North American Indian Portfolio"", these are the two most important works of 19th century North American Indian study. McKenny's work was based on his travel of the west in the late 1820's. Thomas Hall was the ""academia"" member of the team. Charles Bird King painted the Indian portraits which hung in the Indian Gallery of the War Department. One by one the chiefs and other Indians were brought in to sit for portraits. Other portraits were loosely based on another painter who had traveled with McKenny, J.O. Lewis. The book with the folios and hand-painted lithographs was done in 1836. The significance of this is, that following the transfer of the paintings to the Smithsonian all of the paintings were destroyed in a fire in 1865. So all we have to chronicle those images are these McKenny-Hall lithographs.

Any complete versions of McKenny's folio work are very rare and exist in a few private collections, museums, the Smithsonian etc. There are very few complete versions and most of the lithographs have been removed for framing to display as was this one. This is an authentic and original first edition dated 1837 from the ""History of The Indian Tribes of North America"" by McKenny and Hall. One way to validate authenticity is that on most of the folios the print comes through slightly on the front from leaving it's mark on the back of the page. Along with the folio, each Indian or scene was described in detail.

Provenance: This particular lithograph has impressive provenance having come from the Sondley Library in Asheville, North Carolina. It had been bequeathed to that library by Forster Alexander Sondley (1857-1931). F.A. Sondley was a successful attorney who studied American history and geography and collected Civil War and American Indian artifacts. The seal of the Sondley library is impressed as a round circle on the lithograph. 

A simple but elegant one inch gold leaf frame surrounds the lithograph which is: 
19"" wide x 23 3/4"" high in frame; 
17"" wide x 21 3/4"" high under glass;
and matted to 10 1/4"" wide x 14 1/2"" high.

This is the rarest and most impressive piece done by Genryusai Seiya. This is most probably his masterpiece and one of the most salient pieces he ever produced. After Five Generations in this business, we have never seen another jardinière by Genryusai Seiya in this particular model/subject. The jardinière rests on a round base in the form of flowing water, which is significant to the upper rounded vessel portion which depicts a boat. The boat is most probably riding on the Great Lake Biwa, which is noted as the largest ancient freshwater lake in Japan. The lake is thought to be approximately 4 million years old and holds great significance to culture, literature, and the environment of Japan. 

The Jardinière is made up of one continuous patinated bronze cast with very high and low relief subjects. The passengers of this boat range from a elderly fisherman, to a woman with her child, to woman in a kimono, and many more. Each ultra-high relief figure is hand-chiseled with the utmost quality and detail, no other piece can compare in perfection. The faces, hands, hair, and objects each person holds are so perfectly constructed that they seem absolutely real. 

Fine Japanese art is known to be top-quality, but this piece is exceptional, with the most impressive dark black patina over an illustrious extremally well developed bronze body. Each person on the jardinière has a story, each is on the boat for a particular reason heading to an important place. Genryusai Seiya created this piece to spark the creative expression of anyone who sees it. The individuals each share a different life, which is presented differently to anyone that views it. This creative inspiration that is evoked person to person demonstrates how prolific Genryusai Seiya is as an artist. His works are truly perfect and this is piece the culmination to all this masterpieces. A picture speaks a thousand words, but a piece of art in bronze has an endless amount of stories to be told. The Japanese are known as a people of excellence, mannerism, creativity, and perfection. This piece encompasses all those ideas and more.

Introduced at Meissen in the early 1700s in monochrome red or blue, the 'Dragon' pattern is thought to have been inspired by a Japanese porcelain prototype. It in turn incorporating Chinese symbols, such as the dragon, sparring phoenix and ribbon-tied precious objects. In addition to pieces made for the Royal Court at Dresden, a substantial quantity of Meissen porcelain in the Chinese and Japanese style was made around 1729-31 for the French merchant, Lemaire. In 1733, much of this early production was confiscated and later transferred to the Dresden Japanese Palace of Augustus Rex. The pattern was much admired at the Saxon court and was subsequently produced for its exclusive use. Those destined for the Royal Saxon Court Confectioner’s or the ‘Ko¨nigliche-Hof-Conditorei’ were initialed on the underside with a distinctive K.H.C. mark. In the 19th and 20th century, alongside the Asian inspired ‘Blue Onion’ pattern, the ‘Dragon’ decor grew to be one of the most popular patterns produced at Meissen. A variety of monochrome and polychrome examples were made, the ‘Rich Golden Dragon’ being one of the most coveted.

A Meissen porcelain figure from the Love Series: Cupid Mailing a Love Letter with a Love Bird. Circa 1870, this piece epitomizes the finest quality in terms of craftsmanship, painting, and colors. In excellent condition, this absolutely beautiful creation showcases a finely painted chubby cupid with a gorgeously detailed face.

The cupid's features include lovely clear blue eyes and curly hair, meticulously rendered with hand-painted strands in curls, displaying a rich chestnut brown hue. A powder blue ribbon adorns his head like a band. His wings, all aflutter on his back, reveal exquisite detailing in the form and hand-painted nuances of each feather.

Standing atop a highly naturalistic hand-painted ground, the cupid is surrounded by intricate foliate and a beautiful unfurling flower, while leaning on a meticulously rendered tree stump. Draped in a swath of lemon yellow fabric that billows out behind him, Cupid is poised with charm. In his left hand, he cradles a beautiful plump pink flaming heart, while his right hand proudly holds up high a delicately painted dove with wings outstretched, bearing a love letter tied about its neck and chest.

Adding to the cupid's ensemble is a delicate pale pink and gilt sash, securing a khaki green gilt-trimmed quiver containing a finely painted trio of arrows in red, blue, and magenta. The cupid's feet are intricately detailed, with each toenail visible and realistic toning in the flesh throughout his entire body.

The facial features of Cupid are truly sublime, with a beautiful flushed face and an expression that captures the essence of love. The blue and white crossed swords mark of Meissen is clearly present on the round gilt-banded base, attesting to the authenticity and prestige of this exceptional piece. ",0

An extremely rare and unique, one of a kind French gold, diamonds, Silver-gilt rock-crystal, obsidian and lapis lazuli jeweled sculpture ""Bucéphale, Chevaux de légende"", ""Bucephalus, A Legendary Horse"" by Mellerio, Paris, circa 1998.

Sitting on black obsidian base, the solid rock crystal slab is finely applied with a lapis lazuli half-horse with harness mounted in 18k gold and brilliant cut diamonds, between two crystal and lapis lazuli columns adorned with gold and diamonds, insert with 7 ruby cabochons and 1 emerald cabochon, the obsidian base with a plaque engraved: CHEVAUX DE LEGENDE / MELLERIO DITS MELLER / PARIS / 5029 DIV

Bucephalus (c355-326 BC) is among the most famous horses in history, and it was said that this he could not be tamed. The young Alexander the Great, of course, tamed him – and went on to ride his beloved equine companion for many years and into many battles.

The piece is in excellent condition and comes with a custom made wood case made for transport. It's very elegant and has French hallmarks throughout. A truly magnificent piece.

Founded in France in 1613 by the descendants of Italian immigrants from the Vigezzo Valley in the north of Italy, Mellerio is one of the oldest jewellery houses in Europe. The family business soon attracted the attention of the Royal Court and Marie Antoinette herself reportedly purchased a precious bracelet featuring 7 cameos surrounded by rubies in 1780. Later on, in the 19th century, Mellerio became the official supplier of the French Royal family and the Court of Netherland.

Mellerio creates many jewellery items, all set with rare gems such as peridots, amethysts, aquamarines, citrines and topaz, applying for a patent, the flexible stem, a very supple and light jewellery mechanism. Mellerio remains also well known for their spectacular series of Art Nouveau jewels, created at the beginning of the 20th century, as well as for the creation of trophies rewarding some of the greatest footfall and tennis players of history. In 1993, the jewellery house launched their first watch collection.

Today, Mellerio has stores in Paris, Japan and Hong Kong.

July 14, 1789: this date is known throughout the world as the beginning of the French Revolution. According to a ledger belonging to House of Mellerio, this was also the day that the jeweler sold a golden key to the Comte de Coutance for 10 livres. This ledger, as well as inventories dating as far back as 1768, are the jeweler’s oldest archives. These archives have continued to grow over the years, as the House, established on rue de la Paix in Paris, still lives on today, still in the hands of the same family from Craveggia, in the North of Italy.

The tumultuous history of the Mellerio family in France probably goes as far back as the Italian wars of the Renaissance, but the first official document proving their commercial activity in Paris dates back to 1613. This document is the famous royal warrant awarded by Marie de Medici to a number of Italian families established along the rue des Lombards, including the Mellerios, allowing them to sell “small jewelery items”, therefore granting them a small exception to the traditional monopoly enjoyed by Parisian jewelers. At that time, powerful corporations regulated the operations and customs of Parisian business, but thanks to this exceptional warrant, the Mellerios managed to escape the confines of this framework. Today, this wax-sealed document is kept at the city hall of Craveggia.

From 1613 to the Revolution, the Mellerios lived between France and Italy. The corporations tried many times to put an end to their trade privileges, but all in vain, as a dynasty of sovereigns renewed the warrant. Always marrying and often retiring in Craveggia, the Mellerios continued to maintain their jewelry business in Paris. At first, they did this without a shop. Wearing backpacks (wooden boxes divided into small compartments where jewels were kept), they would tour town fairs around Paris and royal castles.

This is how Jean-Baptiste Mellerio (1765-1850) is said to have sold a bracelet set with rubies and Antique cameos to Marie-Antoinette, which still exists today. Many elements seem to prove the veracity of this anecdote. The queen was particularly fond of cameos, which cover the entire background of her famous jewelry cabinet, and ruby was her favorite stone after diamond. The famous bracelet, reacquired a few years ago by the House of Mellerio, is indeed an 18th century jewel, set with antique cameos representing the profiles of Roman emperors. Two branches of the family were operating in Paris during this time, under the reign of Louis XVI: that of Jean-François (1746-1828), the paternal ancestor of the current Mellerios, and that of Jean-Baptiste (1765-1850).

The French Revolution forced them to return to Italy. However, both Jean-Baptiste and François Mellerio (1772-1843), who was the son of Jean-François, were eventually able to return to Paris after the founding of the Consulate. Jean-Baptiste opened a shop at the Iron Crown of rue Vivienne, and François opened his at the Palais des Tuileries, rue du Coq Saint-Honoré. His well-organized order books give an idea of his high-ranking clientele during the “Old Regime”, among which were the Comte and Comtesse Octave de Segur, the Marquise (later Duchess) de Tourzel, former governess of the royal children, and her daughter, the Comtesse de Bearn, the Craufurds -who organized the flight to Varennes, the Duc and Duchess de Gramont, the Comtesse de Boigne, and Madame de Souza, Talleyrand’s mistress.

We also see the names of the imperial family: Empress Josephine, the Queen of Holland, Princess Elisa, Caroline and Pauline. At that time, the House of Mellerio specialized, among other things, in the trade of antique cameos, a newly fashionable genre of jewel that captured the imagination of all the princesses and noble women of the time.

The years of the Restauration and July Monarchy were among the most glorious. The Bourbons were back on the throne, and the clientele of the House of Mellerio had regained its former wealth. Mellerio supplied Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans, as well as his mother, wife and sister, with sumptuous jewels, including a set of emeralds made piece by piece, while the Duke of Bourbon, last prince of the House of Condé, offered diamonds to his mistress, the scheming Baronne de Feucheres, and Monsieur de LaFayette also bought cameos for one of his granddaughters. For the first time, Mellerio ventured into the world of arts in 1815, when Carlotta Grisi, a famous dancer who created Giselle, as well as an actress named Rachel, bought jewels at the Mellerio store on rue de la Paix.

1848 marked a new turning point. France once again became a Republic. François Mellerio handed the company over to his son, Jean, and the latter decided to travel to Spain to build a new clientele. He later became one of the jewelers of the royal family, and met Eugénie de Montijo, who remained a faithful client when she became empress of the French people. The Imperial years were lavish. During the Second Empire, Paris was a pageant of crinoline dresses designed by Worth, while jewels by Mellerio, Worth’s neighbour on the rue de la Paix, adorned the noble women of the Tuileries court.

The Empress bought pearls. Mathilde Bonaparte bought a magnificent diamond rose. The wealthy families of Russia also entered the scene, the most famous being the princes Yusupov, even richer than the Romanovs. The princess dowager also lived in Paris and bought fabulous emeralds, which were found in the treasure of Sultan Abdul Hamid II at the beginning of the 20th century. Her son, Prince Nicolai Yusupov, also collected precious diamonds, which Jean Mellerio sourced for him all over Europe.

In 1870, at the fall of the Second Empire, the international reputation of the House was too firmly established to be affected by the end of the imperial regime, as shown by an order from the King of Holland. Widower of a princess of Württemberg, William III remarried Princess Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont in 1879, with whom he had one daughter: Wilhelmina, the great-grandmother of the current king of Holland.

A faithful client of Mellerio, in 1888 the king ordered a set of rubies and diamonds in the Henri II style as a Christmas gift to his wife. A diadem, a necklace, brooches, bracelets, earrings and even a fan were set with diamonds and large Burmese rubies. Probably one of the most beautiful ruby suites in the world, this remarkable commission remains in the possession of the royal family of Holland.

At that time of its manufacture, the name of Mellerio was so famous in the world of jewelry that every high-ranking personality visiting Paris would stop at the store on rue de la Paix. The sale ledgers thus mention Queen Victoria, the king of Italy, the czarinas of Russia, kings of Bulgaria and also a number of French-speaking Indian princes, such as the Maharaja of Kapurthala, who ordered a golden hair ornament designed as a peacock, enameled and set with diamonds. Since then, many generations of the Mellerio family have continued to guide their House, which is undoubtedly the first in the history of Parisian jewelry.

This is truly an awe inspiring one of a kind piece made by ""The Modern Day Faberge"" Manfred Wild. The ships haul is made from a single clear hand carved piece of rock crystal. The top of the rock crystal haul is hand-engraved and further etched to appear as if it is made up of individual wooden planks. The ship also consists of two hand carved frosted rock crystal sails, each delicately floating in mid-air and held up by 18-karat gold chains and bars. The ships body is made up of pieces of solid two-tone matte and burnished 18-karat yellow gold, all hand-chased and further chiseled with exceptional detail and the highest quality of craftsmanship. Around either end of the ship are twenty-eight green enamel shields, each with a particular engraved design, and fitted with interchanging bezel-set round sapphire and diamond cabochons. There are two banks of twenty-six Romanesque oars on either side of the galley constructed of solid 18-karat yellow gold. To complete the rowing capacity of the galley, two complimentary solid 18-karat yellow gold and patinated gold rudders can be found on the stern, starboard and port sides. On the stern or back side of the boat is a rounded semi-circular fine-silver dome, decorated in brown enamel with a teardrop shaped emerald finial. A gold winged end is also affixed to the stern with a gold Romanesque finial further enhanced with a gold-beveled circular emerald. Attached to the beveled-emerald are four gold spurs, each with gold-beveled sapphires. Located throughout the galley are over 650 brilliant- cut diamonds, which have been meticulously set in the gold body. The top sail rests on a patinated rod with gold chain-links which attach the sail to the brown enameled stern. An anchor completes the gorgeous Roman galley and demonstrates the care and exceptionally quality of this piece. The entire galley is mounted on a gorgeous black quartzite base set in 18-karat gold. Located in the photos is a document provided by Emil Becker/Manfred Wild explaining every key detail about this Roman galley. There are only two of these Roman galleys in existence. One is in a museum and the other is available for purchase.
According to the document there are 28 green enamel-shields on 18-karat gold 750, three sections of brown enamel on fine-silver, 6 sapphire-cabouchons drops at 3.58-carat., 20 sapphire-cabouchons round at 3.79-carat., 1 emerald-cabouchon drop at 1.17-carat., 1 emerald pampel at 2.31-carat., 2 emerald cabouchons 8 mm. round at 4.97-carat., 11 emerald carres facettet at 2.18-carat., 652 diamonds twvsi at 7.06-carat., 8 diamond-rose-cuts at 1.01-carat., and approximately 1,500 working hours to complete this Museum-Quality masterpiece. According to Wild, the galley consists of 1,620 grams of 18-karat 750 gold, in total, and has a total weight of 14,210 grams, including the base.

According to Museum Collection,
""Manfred Wild is a lapidary artist and jeweler. [He] was born in 1944 in Kirshvayler near the city of Idar-Oberstein. ?? is the eighth representative of the family dynasty that has been engaged in lapidary art since 1630.

Being born in [an] creative environment, since his boyhood Manfred was keen on painting. Besides the educational school, he graduated from the Art and Commercial college. When he was rather young, Wild started his own business together with his wife Ute, the granddaughter of Emil Becker - the owner of the well-known stone-cutting workshop. Originally, Wild’s manufacture specialized on creating copies of the well-known art objects, but as the time passed, it fully switched off to the designed items production.

Manfred Wild is sometimes called “The 21st century Faberge”. This comparison is quite reasonable. He managed not only to capture the delicate technology of stone and metal processing, but to create his own recognizable style as well, having carefully rendered the best skills and techniques of the greatest artisans of the past.

The author’s works are exhibited in the world largest museums and galleries, such as The Gemstones museum in Idar-Oberstein, Harvard museum in Boston, Jewelry art museum in Korea. Besides, Wild’s works are the dreamed exhibits for private collectors all over the world"".

Drawing inspiration from the renowned ""Bust of Alexander the Great (356-323 BC)"" housed in the esteemed Palace of Versailles, this monumental work of art showcases exceptional craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail, serving as a testament to the creator's artistic prowess.

Central to this magnificent sculpture is the resplendent red marble face, neck, and hair of Alexander the Great. Capturing the youthful essence of the conqueror, the sculptor depicts him as a young man with a clean-shaven countenance, his moderately long curls delicately cascading from beneath a remarkably unadorned helmet, save for a magnificent plume. The red marble harmoniously accentuates the life-like features of Alexander, imparting an air of regal elegance to the composition.

Adding to the allure of this remarkable sculpture is an ormolu robe cascading over Alexander's shoulders, exuding an aura of nobility and power. Of particular note, the breastplate bears an embossed ormolu mask of a deity in profile, surrounded by elegantly sweeping acanthus leaves, paying homage to the influential forces that shaped the life of this great conqueror. Once again, the sublime combination of precious metal and marble amplifies the robe's magnificence, further accentuated by the presence of an ormolu body chain swaying gracefully from Alexander's left shoulder to his right hip.

The selection of marbles for the cuirass and plinth serves as an additional testament to the artist's commitment to crafting a visually striking and harmonious composition. The grey marble cuirass complements the overall color scheme of the bust while providing a subtle contrast to the red marble features. At the neck, a pleated ormolu linen undergarment discreetly peeks out, showcasing the artist's meticulous attention to intricate details and enhancing the sculpture's depth.  The original Alexander The Great Bust is housed within the esteemed Palace of Versailles, it serves as a compelling homage to the extraordinary achievements and indelible impact of one of history's most renowned figures.

The original bust consists of provenance from the former collection of Cardinal de Richelieu. Given by the Duchess of Aiguillon, niece of the cardinal, to Francois Girardon who restored it and completed it with an armor of green veined marble from Egypt and gilded bronze. Purchased in 1715 by the Duc d'Estrées. Purchased in 1738 by the Comte de Maurepas on behalf of Louis XV and placed in the Cabinet du Conseil. Deposit of the Louvre museum in Versailles in 1953.",0

They usually break due to their sheer weight and constant hand-work before perfection, making these piece even more rare than usual. These pieces were both signed by the artist who completed their painting, a rarity in the Sèvres Porcelain world.

On a small island in the Venetian lagoon, Murano, artists make magic with common materials and great artistry. While it is believed that glass making started in the 8th century in Venice, it is known that in 1291 the glass makers were moved to this somewhat isolated island, so that their furnaces would not burn the city down. 

The colorful glass has long been a favorite with collectors. The Art Deco period to which these massive lamps belong was one of the most productive periods. Each piece is hand made so no two are identical. The sleek Art Deco shapes contrast well with the richness of the Bronze Dore Mounts, yet will find a comfortable home in any decor.

These magnificent handcrafted urns are carved from the uniquely Swedish Porphyry stone, rest on square plinths. Purchased from Didier Aaron in Paris by Michael Taylor.

A vase of this shape based on the Borghese vase in the Louvre is shown in a French catalogue of 1805 advertising porphyry from Elfdal in Sweden (H. Sundblom et al., Porfyr, exhibition catalogue, December 1985-February 1986, p.31). A vase of the same shape and size in Blyberg porphyry was also included in this Exhibition (no. 24). Älvdalen (Elfdal) in Sweden appears to have been the only place in Europe since Antiquity where porphyry has been mined seriously. Mining started in the 1780s and the works were bought by Charles XIV, the first of the Bernadotte Kings of Sweden, in order to realize Bernadotte's ambition to bring the splendour of the French Empire style to Sweden. During this period many items in porphyry were distributed throughout Europe as diplomatic presents and sold by the Royal Family in 1856. The works were destroyed by fire ten years later and subsequent production was sporadic and limited.

A pair of nearly identical vases was sold from the Property of the late Dowager Countess Howe, Christie's, London, 4 June 1992, lot 102, and another single urn from the collection of Peter Glenville and Hardy William Smith, Christie's, New York, 17 October 2004, lot 27.",0

They are further adorned with 24k matte and burnished gold decoration, bringing another level of excellence to these magnificent pieces. Each vase was made separately in 2 pieces, because in the 1800s, glass of this size could not be fired and blown in one individual section; to compensate for this, the master glaffer would fire two individual sections and combine them into one magnificent piece. This sectionalized design was not only necessary, but functional as well.

He trained in London and continued his studies in Belguim, France and Holland.  He also spent time studying in Paris and in Brittany, painting almost always in watercolours.  It was in Brittany that he met and became good friends with Dublin born Stanhope Alexander Forbes.

Todd moved to Cornwall in 1883 and the following year Stanhope Forbes joined him.   The Newlyn School also included Frank Bramley, William Blandford Fletcher, William Wainwright, William Breaksphere, Frank Bodily, Fred Millard and Edwin Harris.   Todd struggled throughout his life to make a living from his art,  was frequently unable to buy materials and plagued with debt.  His work has since been recognised and fetches high prices at auction.  His son, Ralph Middleton Todd who was born in 1891 in Helston was a renowed artist in his own right, studying under Stanhope Forbes and later becoming a renowned first world war artist and was elected RA in 1945.

This painting is an original watercolour by Ralph Todd and dates from around 1890, painted whilst still living in Cornwall, and of a young woman in a wide pink bonnet and carrying a basket.  

It is a charming well executed composition and coveys simply and beautifully the daily life, colours and atmosphere of the working people of Cornwall in the late Victorian period.

A charming bonus is that when removed from the frame, the back of the painting shows where the artist was testing his colours, drafting and outlining elements seen in the final composition.

From its inception in the 17th century to its modern-day prominence, Odiot has remained a beacon of superior quality in the world of silverware, cherished by royalty and connoisseurs alike.

The Odiot legacy began in 1690 with Jean-Baptiste Gaspard Odiot, who established the family business in Paris. As a silversmith, he quickly garnered attention for his exceptional skill and innovative designs. However, it was his grandson, Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot (1763-1850), who elevated the family name to international acclaim.  Jean-Baptiste Claude took over the family workshop during a period of significant political and social upheaval in France—the time of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Despite these challenges, he managed to not only sustain the business but also to expand it significantly. His reputation for creating extraordinary pieces in the Empire style—characterized by its grandeur, classical motifs, and opulence—attracted the attention of Napoleon Bonaparte himself. Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot became the official silversmith to the Emperor, and this royal patronage catapulted the Odiot name into the annals of French history.  Under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Claude, the Odiot workshop produced some of the most exquisite pieces of silverware ever seen, many of which were commissioned by Napoleon for himself, his family, and his court. These pieces were not merely functional objects but works of art, embodying the splendor and power of the Napoleonic Empire.

Odiot’s reputation for quality and craftsmanship is built on centuries of dedication to the highest standards of silversmithing. The firm's artisans have always been known for their meticulous attention to detail, their mastery of traditional techniques, and their ability to innovate within the craft. Each piece of Odiot silverware is a testament to the skill and artistry of the silversmiths who create them.  In addition to their use of superior materials, Odiot is also known for their exceptional design and execution. The firm’s designs often draw on historical styles, particularly the Empire, Renaissance, and Rococo styles, which are characterized by intricate detailing, classical motifs, and a sense of grandeur. However, Odiot’s artisans are not mere imitators of past styles; they are innovators who bring their own creativity and vision to each piece they create.  One of the most notable aspects of Odiot’s craftsmanship is their ability to combine form and function. While their pieces are undoubtedly works of art, they are also designed to be used and enjoyed. Whether it is a lavishly decorated tea set or a simple flatware set, each piece is crafted with the user in mind, ensuring that it is as functional as it is beautiful.

Royal patronage has played a crucial role in the history and success of Odiot. From the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, who appointed Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot as his official silversmith, the Odiot firm has been associated with the highest levels of power and prestige.  Napoleon’s patronage was not only a mark of the firm’s excellence but also a significant factor in its growth and success. The Emperor commissioned numerous pieces from Odiot, including a famous set of gold flatware that was used at his coronation banquet. These commissions were not only lucrative but also helped to establish Odiot’s reputation as one of the finest silversmiths in Europe.  The firm’s association with royalty did not end with Napoleon. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Odiot continued to receive commissions from royal families and aristocrats across Europe. Among their most famous patrons were Louis XVIII, Charles X, and Louis-Philippe of France, as well as Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King William IV of the United Kingdom.  These royal commissions often involved the creation of elaborate and luxurious pieces, such as large table services, tea sets, and ceremonial objects. The fact that Odiot was chosen to create these pieces is a testament to the firm’s reputation for quality and craftsmanship. Royal patronage not only provided financial support but also served as an endorsement of the firm’s excellence, helping to attract other high-profile clients and secure Odiot’s place in history.

Throughout its history, Odiot has been the recipient of numerous awards and accolades, further solidifying its reputation as one of the world’s finest silversmiths. These awards are not only a recognition of the firm’s craftsmanship but also a testament to its ability to innovate and push the boundaries of the craft.  One of the earliest and most significant awards won by Odiot was the gold medal at the 1802 Exposition des Produits de l’Industrie Française, held in Paris. This was the first industrial exposition of its kind, and winning a gold medal was a major achievement, especially given the fierce competition. The award was a recognition of Odiot’s technical skill and artistic creativity, and it helped to establish the firm’s reputation both in France and abroad.  Odiot continued to receive accolades throughout the 19th century, including a series of medals at the Great Exhibitions held in London, Paris, and other major cities. These exhibitions were showcases of the latest industrial and artistic achievements, and winning a medal was a mark of distinction. Odiot’s success at these events was a reflection of the firm’s ability to stay at the forefront of the craft, continually innovating and producing work of the highest quality.  In addition to these formal awards, Odiot has also been recognized by its peers and by collectors for its contributions to the art of silversmithing. The firm’s pieces are highly sought after by collectors and are often featured in major museum collections, including the Louvre in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The inclusion of Odiot’s work in these prestigious collections is a testament to its historical and artistic significance.

Among the many magnificent creations of Odiot, the Chateaubriant pattern stands out as one of the most sought-after and admired. This pattern, named after the famous French writer and statesman François-René de Chateaubriant, is a quintessential example of Odiot’s ability to combine artistry and functionality in a way that few other silversmiths can match.  The Chateaubriant pattern is characterized by its elegant and refined design, which is both timeless and distinctive. The pattern features a combination of classical motifs, such as acanthus leaves, scrolls, and rosettes, which are meticulously engraved onto the handles of each piece. The design is both intricate and harmonious, with each element carefully balanced to create a sense of unity and coherence.  One of the most remarkable aspects of the Chateaubriant pattern is the level of detail that is achieved in the engraving. The artisans at Odiot are known for their precision and skill, and this is evident in the fine, crisp lines and the delicate shading that give the design its depth and texture. The engraving is done by hand, using traditional techniques that have been passed down through generations of Odiot silversmiths. This attention to detail is what sets the Chateaubriant pattern apart from other silverware and makes it so highly prized by collectors.  In addition to its aesthetic qualities, the Chateaubriant pattern is also renowned for its functionality. The pieces are designed to be comfortable to hold and easy to use, with a balance and weight that makes them a pleasure to handle. The knives, forks, and spoons in the Chateaubriant pattern are not only beautiful but also practical, making them suitable for both formal and everyday use.  

The legacy of Odiot is a testament to the enduring appeal of superior craftsmanship and timeless design. Over the course of more than three centuries, the house of Odiot has consistently demonstrated a commitment to excellence, producing silverware that is both beautiful and functional. Their association with royalty, numerous awards, and accolades, and the continued admiration of their work by collectors and connoisseurs all speak to the exceptional quality of their creations.

The art of silver-smithing has a long and storied history, with many renowned artisans contributing to its development. Among these, the name Odiot stands out as a beacon of exceptional quality, exquisite craftsmanship, and timeless elegance. Founded in Paris in the late 17th century, the House of Odiot has become synonymous with luxurious silverware, revered by royalty and connoisseurs alike. 

The story of Odiot begins in 1690 with the establishment of the company by Jean-Baptiste Gaspard Odiot in Paris. Jean-Baptiste was a skilled silversmith, whose work quickly gained recognition for its elegance and superior craftsmanship. However, it was his grandson, Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot, who truly elevated the family's legacy.  Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot (1763-1850) took over the family business during the tumultuous period of the French Revolution. Despite the challenges of the era, he managed to secure significant commissions, including work for Napoleon Bonaparte. Odiot became the official silversmith to Napoleon, creating some of the most iconic pieces of the Empire style, characterized by its grandeur and classical influences. This period marked the beginning of Odiot's enduring association with royalty and the elite.

Throughout the 19th century, the House of Odiot continued to flourish under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Claude's descendants. They expanded their clientele to include many European royal courts, further cementing their reputation as one of the premier silversmiths of the time. The Odiot name became synonymous with luxury and refinement, a legacy that continues to this day.  The hallmark of Odiot's silverware is its unparalleled quality and meticulous craftsmanship. Each piece is a testament to the skills and dedication of the artisans who create them. Odiot's workshops have always been known for their commitment to traditional techniques, while also embracing innovation to enhance their creations.

The process of creating Odiot silverware involves several intricate steps, each requiring a high level of expertise. From the initial design to the final polishing, every stage is carried out with precision. The designs often draw inspiration from classical motifs, reflecting the neoclassical and Empire styles that have long been associated with the brand. The attention to detail is remarkable, with intricate engravings, repoussé work, and finely chased decorations adorning many of their creations.  One of the most impressive aspects of Odiot's craftsmanship is their ability to seamlessly blend artistry with functionality. Their pieces are not only beautiful but also practical, designed to be used and cherished for generations. This combination of aesthetics and utility is a testament to their mastery of the silversmith's art.

Odiot's association with royalty began with Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot's work for Napoleon Bonaparte. The Emperor's admiration for Odiot's craftsmanship led to numerous commissions, including grandiose pieces for the Imperial court. One of the most famous works from this period is the massive silver gilt service created for Napoleon, which included elaborate centerpieces, candelabras, and tureens.  The House of Odiot's reputation for excellence quickly spread beyond France. They received commissions from various European royal courts, including those of Russia, Sweden, and England. Notable patrons included Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King Charles X of France. Each of these commissions further solidified Odiot's status as the silversmith of choice for the elite.  One of the most significant royal patrons of Odiot was Queen Marie-Amélie of France, wife of King Louis-Philippe. She commissioned numerous pieces from Odiot, including a stunning silver tea service that exemplified the refined elegance of the era. The patronage of such high-profile clients not only provided financial stability but also enhanced the prestige of the Odiot brand.

Odiot's exceptional craftsmanship and innovative designs have earned them numerous awards and accolades over the centuries. Their participation in various international exhibitions and fairs has consistently garnered praise and recognition.  One of the earliest accolades came at the 1802 Exposition des Produits de l'Industrie Française, where Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot was awarded a gold medal for his outstanding work. This recognition helped to establish his reputation as one of the leading silversmiths of his time.  Odiot continued to receive acclaim at subsequent exhibitions, including the 1823 Exhibition in Paris and the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. At the Great Exhibition, Odiot's display of silverware was met with great admiration, earning them a medal and further solidifying their international reputation.  In addition to these public accolades, Odiot has also received numerous private commissions and honors from royal families and dignitaries. These endorsements serve as a testament to the enduring appeal and unmatched quality of their creations.

Among Odiot's many masterpieces, their 950 sterling silver vegetable servers (tureens) stand out as exemplary pieces of functional art. These tureens are not only utilitarian objects but also magnificent works of art that showcase the finest elements of Odiot's craftsmanship.  The design of these vegetable servers is a harmonious blend of elegance and practicality. Each tureen is crafted from 950 sterling silver, ensuring a brilliant finish and exceptional durability. The higher silver content compared to standard sterling silver gives these pieces a richer, more lustrous appearance, making them the centerpiece of any dining table.

The tureens are often adorned with intricate engravings and repoussé work, featuring classical motifs such as acanthus leaves, scrolls, and floral patterns. These decorative elements are meticulously crafted, demonstrating the skill and attention to detail that are the hallmarks of Odiot's work. The lids of the tureens typically feature elegantly sculpted handles, often in the form of naturalistic shapes like fruits or leaves, adding a touch of whimsy to the overall design. Functionality is a key consideration in the design of Odiot's tureens. The lids fit snugly to keep the contents warm, and the handles are designed for ease of use. The interiors are often gilded, providing a beautiful contrast to the silver exterior and ensuring that the tureens are not only visually stunning but also practical for serving food.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Odiot's tureens is their ability to convey a sense of timelessness. Despite being created in the 19th century, their designs remain relevant and appealing today. This enduring quality is a testament to the mastery of the artisans at Odiot, who have managed to create pieces that transcend the fashions of their time.  The House of Odiot is a true testament to the art of silver-smithing, combining a rich history with an unwavering commitment to quality and craftsmanship. From their early days in the late 17th century to their status as a premier silversmith for European royalty, Odiot has consistently produced pieces of exceptional beauty and functionality.

The art of silver-smithing has a long and storied history, with many renowned artisans contributing to its development. Among these, the name Odiot stands out as a beacon of exceptional quality, exquisite craftsmanship, and timeless elegance. Founded in Paris in the late 17th century, the House of Odiot has become synonymous with luxurious silverware, revered by royalty and connoisseurs alike. 

The story of Odiot begins in 1690 with the establishment of the company by Jean-Baptiste Gaspard Odiot in Paris. Jean-Baptiste was a skilled silversmith, whose work quickly gained recognition for its elegance and superior craftsmanship. However, it was his grandson, Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot, who truly elevated the family's legacy.  Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot (1763-1850) took over the family business during the tumultuous period of the French Revolution. Despite the challenges of the era, he managed to secure significant commissions, including work for Napoleon Bonaparte. Odiot became the official silversmith to Napoleon, creating some of the most iconic pieces of the Empire style, characterized by its grandeur and classical influences. This period marked the beginning of Odiot's enduring association with royalty and the elite.

Throughout the 19th century, the House of Odiot continued to flourish under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Claude's descendants. They expanded their clientele to include many European royal courts, further cementing their reputation as one of the premier silversmiths of the time. The Odiot name became synonymous with luxury and refinement, a legacy that continues to this day.  The hallmark of Odiot's silverware is its unparalleled quality and meticulous craftsmanship. Each piece is a testament to the skills and dedication of the artisans who create them. Odiot's workshops have always been known for their commitment to traditional techniques, while also embracing innovation to enhance their creations.

The process of creating Odiot silverware involves several intricate steps, each requiring a high level of expertise. From the initial design to the final polishing, every stage is carried out with precision. The designs often draw inspiration from classical motifs, reflecting the neoclassical and Empire styles that have long been associated with the brand. The attention to detail is remarkable, with intricate engravings, repoussé work, and finely chased decorations adorning many of their creations.  One of the most impressive aspects of Odiot's craftsmanship is their ability to seamlessly blend artistry with functionality. Their pieces are not only beautiful but also practical, designed to be used and cherished for generations. This combination of aesthetics and utility is a testament to their mastery of the silversmith's art.

Odiot's association with royalty began with Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot's work for Napoleon Bonaparte. The Emperor's admiration for Odiot's craftsmanship led to numerous commissions, including grandiose pieces for the Imperial court. One of the most famous works from this period is the massive silver gilt service created for Napoleon, which included elaborate centerpieces, candelabras, and tureens.  The House of Odiot's reputation for excellence quickly spread beyond France. They received commissions from various European royal courts, including those of Russia, Sweden, and England. Notable patrons included Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King Charles X of France. Each of these commissions further solidified Odiot's status as the silversmith of choice for the elite.  One of the most significant royal patrons of Odiot was Queen Marie-Amélie of France, wife of King Louis-Philippe. She commissioned numerous pieces from Odiot, including a stunning silver tea service that exemplified the refined elegance of the era. The patronage of such high-profile clients not only provided financial stability but also enhanced the prestige of the Odiot brand.

Odiot's exceptional craftsmanship and innovative designs have earned them numerous awards and accolades over the centuries. Their participation in various international exhibitions and fairs has consistently garnered praise and recognition.  One of the earliest accolades came at the 1802 Exposition des Produits de l'Industrie Française, where Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot was awarded a gold medal for his outstanding work. This recognition helped to establish his reputation as one of the leading silversmiths of his time.  Odiot continued to receive acclaim at subsequent exhibitions, including the 1823 Exhibition in Paris and the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. At the Great Exhibition, Odiot's display of silverware was met with great admiration, earning them a medal and further solidifying their international reputation.  In addition to these public accolades, Odiot has also received numerous private commissions and honors from royal families and dignitaries. These endorsements serve as a testament to the enduring appeal and unmatched quality of their creations.

Among Odiot's many masterpieces, their 950 sterling silver vegetable servers (tureens) stand out as exemplary pieces of functional art. These tureens are not only utilitarian objects but also magnificent works of art that showcase the finest elements of Odiot's craftsmanship.  The design of these vegetable servers is a harmonious blend of elegance and practicality. Each tureen is crafted from 950 sterling silver, ensuring a brilliant finish and exceptional durability. The higher silver content compared to standard sterling silver gives these pieces a richer, more lustrous appearance, making them the centerpiece of any dining table.

The tureens are often adorned with intricate engravings and repoussé work, featuring classical motifs such as acanthus leaves, scrolls, and floral patterns. These decorative elements are meticulously crafted, demonstrating the skill and attention to detail that are the hallmarks of Odiot's work. The lids of the tureens typically feature elegantly sculpted handles, often in the form of naturalistic shapes like fruits or leaves, adding a touch of whimsy to the overall design. Functionality is a key consideration in the design of Odiot's tureens. The lids fit snugly to keep the contents warm, and the handles are designed for ease of use. The interiors are often gilded, providing a beautiful contrast to the silver exterior and ensuring that the tureens are not only visually stunning but also practical for serving food.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Odiot's tureens is their ability to convey a sense of timelessness. Despite being created in the 19th century, their designs remain relevant and appealing today. This enduring quality is a testament to the mastery of the artisans at Odiot, who have managed to create pieces that transcend the fashions of their time.  The House of Odiot is a true testament to the art of silver-smithing, combining a rich history with an unwavering commitment to quality and craftsmanship.

Adana Situated in the fertile Çukurova plain (previously known as the Cilician plain, through which the Seyhan and Ceyhan rivers run), Adana is a busy Industrial and agricultural center. The region has always benefited from its location on the Arab and Anatolian trade routes by controlling the passes through the Taurus Mountains to Syria. A Hittite settlement existed there from 1400 BC and the land was conquered by Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC. From the late thirteenth century to the eighteenth century Adana was ruled by the Turkoman Ramazan dynasty, succeeded in turn by Ottoman rule. Large kilims made in two halves often have medallions of various shapes hexagonal diamonds, for example - as a main feature, whereas others have small and repetitive motifs, such as a hooked diamond shape enclosed within a hexagon, filling the main field. Single borders are usually found on both large and small kilims. The small kilims differ widely in design; amongst others, some prayer-arch kilims and some with hexagonal hooked motifs can be seen. Kilims continue to be woven in the villages of the Adana region that are made according to the weavers' taste, and as with other modern village kilims, the colors need the benefit of two months' sun-fading to become saleable. The Adana region produces much cotton, and its kilims often have cotton warps. Cotton is also used for color contrast in both border and field, where reds, pink, orange, green, purple, and blue fading to grey are also common. The older kilims are of medium- and fine-spun wool whereas the modern kilims are becoming very coarse and loosely woven. Slitweave is the prevalent weaving technique in the area.
On the far west tip of the Cilician plain, south-west of Adana and close to the Mediterranean Sea, the town of Silifke was founded in the third century BC by the Alexandran general Seleucus Nicator, who established the Seleucid dynasty that ruled Syria. Silifke is also known as the place where Emperor Frederick Barbarossa met his demise during the Third Crusade, by falling off his horse into the river! Kilims made in this region are normally small or medium in Size. Yastiks and çuval are also woven in çiçim, zili, and weft-wrapping techniques. The design often consists of a thin elibelinde mother-goddess motif repeated in different colors in vertical lines - this creates an interesting three-dimensional effect. Colors used include red, brown, orange, pink, some blue and green, and white cotton.

Adana kilims have a beautiful red color, and you can see many colorful and beautiful kilims like this. This red also has various shades depending on the uneven dyeing. The patterns on the left and right fields are sheep horns. Even in each color, the uneven dyeing abrage is beautifully expressed. Various colors such as pastel colors and primary colors are used generously for the top and bottom and right borders. The central seam and the surrounding white accentuate these colors.
Beautiful kilims resembling large butterflies are wonderfully suited to antique floors and tatami mats in old Japanese houses.
Even in a dimly lit room with a dark-tone fireplace, under a long dining table, and so on, a bright piece like this will create a very tasteful space.",0

Alexander Helwig Wyant (January 11, 1836 – November 29, 1892) was an American landscape painter. His early works belonged to the Hudson River School, with its direct pastoral narrative. Raised in Defiance, Ohio, Alexander H. Wyant worked during his teens as a sign painter in nearby Port Washington. In 1857 he was impressed with some paintings by George Inness at an exhibition in Cincinnati and soon left for New York to meet Inness. After returning to Cincinnati, Wyant secured the support of Nicholas Longworth and went to study in New York in 1860

Old bird print depicting Latham's Guillemot. This print originates from 'The new and heretofore unfigured species of the birds of North America', published 1866-1869.

This spectacular large folio lithograph is from Daniel Giraud Elliot's The New and Heretofore Unfigured Species of the Birds of North America. The work was published in New York for the author between 1866 and 1869. Each lithograph features original hand-coloring. The plates were predmoninantly executed by Bowen of Philadelphia after originals by Elliot and celebrated natural history artist, Joseph Wolf. It is believed only 200 copies of this work were ever printed. 

The work generally depicted life-size renderings of birds that were not previously illustrated by Alexander Wilson or John James Audubon. It had a particular focus on birds of the American West including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. It also depicts some birds from the Alaskand and Arctic regions. Many of birds were drawn from birds brought back from government-led expeditions in the West as well as private sources including John Xantus de Vesey. 

Elliot’s lithographs are some of the most valuable American bird plates. Elliot was a prominent American zoologist. He was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the American Ornithologists’ Union. Elliot was also curator of zoology at Chicago’s Field Museum. 

In the preface, Elliot describes his intentions for the work: ""Since the time of Wilson and Audubon, no work has been published upon American Ornithology, containing life-size representations of the various species that have been discovered since the labors of those great men were finished. The valuable productions of Cassin, as well as the revised edition of the ninth volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, the joint labor of Messrs. Baird, Cassin and Lawrence had indeed appeared . but no attempt had been made to continue the works of the first great American naturalists in a similar manner . It was, therefore, with the desire to contribute . towards the elucidation of the comparatively little known species of the Birds of North America, their habits and economy, as well as to render their forms familiar so far as life-size representation of them might serve to do, that I undertook the present publication.""

Paper photograph mounted on board, on it’s original matting.

Taken by famous photographer John Mack Moore of Vicksburg and signed by him in red ink on bottom left “J Mack Moore’ and “Vicksburg, Miss” on the bottom right (also in red ink).

Hand-noted in black ink on rear as “Virginia Tablet, Vicksburg National Military Park” and also signed again by J. Mack Moore in red ink on left center on the rear and “Vicksburg, Miss” on the right center (also in red ink).

Newly framed and matted and under glass.

Original photos by J. Mack Moore are ‘highly’ sought after and have performed very well at auction.

John Mack Moore, born in 1869, was the son of prominent residents of antebellum Vicksburg. He was only a toddler when the famous 1870 race between the Robt. E. Lee and Natchez had his hometown in a state of excitement as the big sidewheelers passed upriver en route from New Orleans to St. Louis. As a young man, he became an avid and skilled photographer, spending much time at the wharf along the Mississippi and Yazoo, recording on glass plate negatives the daily activity of the busy river landing.

Conversations with masters, mates, mud clerks and roustabouts were his daily fare. Moore learned photography from an elderly master of albumen, wet plates and homemade printing papers. He had a disdain for newfangled gadgetry and held fast to utilizing the old methods of previous decades in the making of photographs, with sparkling results.

J. Mack Moore was considered the dean of photographers as well as a colorful character around Vicksburg. In later years, owing to his white hair and moustache, he was said by many to bear a close resemblance to Mark Twain.

Moore’s Clay Street home, where he also operated his photographic studio, was built from the top down, a most amazing feat accomplished by a unique individual. Originally it was a rambling residence in a Southern, park-like setting. However, when paved streets eventually came to the city, the house was left at the base of an embankment, the large oak trees removed to make way for an unsightly culvert. Singlehandedly, Moore raised the house to street level. As the edifice gradually rose, Moore fashioned lower floors, accomplishing the feat with heavy timbers and screw jacks. When the home was 12 feet above the ground, he added a lower floor and then took the whole structure up another six feet before placing the foundation timbers. The noise of street traffic so annoyed him that Moore kept his studio and living quarters for his wife and himself in the lower levels.

Each year the couple took a vacation, most often on steamboats, to the New Orleans Mardi Gras, a tradition beginning with their honeymoon.

Moore’s detailed photographs were eagerly sought by river people, historians and collectors the world over. When the huge steam towboat Sprague was retired in 1948 at Vicksburg, he donated a large number of steamboat prints for the River Hall of Fame. Following Moore’s death in 1954, the glass plate negatives were purchased by the Warren County Historical Society and accessioned by curator Eva W. Davis into the collections of the Old Court House Museum. Here they are forever preserved and available to researchers seeking images from a colorful time never to come again. Including some 1,100 plates, the photographs include scenes of not only riverboats, but everyday life in Vicksburg. In 1994, Gordon Cotton showed me some of the museum’s wondrous photo collection.

Thanks to the skilled artistry of J. Mack Moore, Vicksburg’s foremost photographer, fascinating images of such fabled steamboats as the J.M. White, America, Belle of the Bends, Kate Robbins, Natchez, Robt. E. Lee, Tennessee Belle and countless others were captured on film for the edification of generations yet unborn. 

The Virginia State Memorial is located outside Vicksburg National Military Park on former park property in the City of Vicksburg. It is situated on the southeast corner of the North Frontage Road and Iowa Avenue. The bronze plaque, mounted on a granite pedestal, represents the Botetourt Artillery, the only Virginia unit to participate in the defense of Vicksburg. The memorial was the first Confederate tablet to be placed in the park and dedicated on November 23, 1907. The entire monument cost of $520 was raised by donations.

The son of a respected storekeeper, Francis G. Obenchain was born in Botecourt County, Va., in 1843. In 1861, Obenchain enlisted in the Confederate Army as part of the “Mountain Rifles.” This unit was also briefly part of Co. H, 28th Va. Vol. Inf., before it was converted into a light artillery battery in 1861. Renamed the Botetourt Artillery, the War Department assigned the unit to the war’s eastern theater in 1862, where it was the only Virginia unit to participate in the Vicksburg campaign. Obenchain served as the unit’s temporary commander during the Battle of Port Gibson (May 1, 1863) and during the siege of Vicksburg (May-July 1863). Captured and paroled, Obenchain and his battery returned to Virginia, where it took part in the artillery duel at New River Bridge (May 10, 1864) and in the defense of Lynchburg (June 1864). In 1873, Obenchain left Virginia and eventually settled in Chicago, where he worked as a miller’s agent and was member of the Chicago Flour Exchange. He also maintained a residence in Miami, Fla.

Francis Gardiner Obenchain, was a brother of Major William Alexander Obenchain (one of 12 siblings) who also fought in the Civil War to much acclaim.

This photo was part of Major WA Obenchain’s Estate. We have a number of important items in this Collection, ALL posted separately.

Raoul Dufy was a renowned artist that created excellent works of art in both contemporary and Mid-Century Modern styles. This is an original vintage poster, not a reprint. 

The printer, Atelier Mourlot, established in 1852, began as a producer of Fine wallpaper in Paris, France. In 1914, Jules Mourlot expanded the operation to include printing illustrated books and lithographic posters for art institutions, including the French National Museum. By 1937, with Jules’ son Fernand Mourlot at the helm, Atelier Mourlot became the largest and most famous print shop of the 20th century.

Fernand Mourlot graduated from the École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. Inside of the Atelier, he collaborated with highly recognized artists, including modern masters Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Joan Miró, Marc Chagall, Fernand Léger, Jean Dubuffet, Henry Moore and Le Corbusier, for more than half a century to produce original lithographic works.

In 1967, The Atelier Mourlot opened a branch of the studio on Bank Street, in New York City, and collaborated with artists including Robert Rauschenberg, Francis Bacon, Roy Lichtenstein, Alexander Calder, Ellsworth Kelly, Alex Katz and Claes Oldenburg to produce contemporary lithographic masterpieces. The studio closed in 1999.

In the following years he had traveled down many creative roads to Central America, seeing the sights of the ancient beginnings of man, local traditions and environment. The influence of Central American and Caribbean flavor is visible in Gore’s art.

After 10 years of painting in New York, Alexander Gore moved to Miami, where he opened his own gallery. The hot southern palette has had a cheerful effect on his paintings, which have been nurtured by sun., epitaph and happiness of life. Invigorated by the energy of being in Miami, Alexander Gore produced more than 6,000 original works that found a home in art collections all over the country and around the world.

“In my art”, Alexander Gore says, “ I try to convey the organic movement of color across the canvas by using a strong line that hints all the shapes to come. Alexander’s works give a picture of black lines, curvy characters and intricate touches, creating an atmosphere for the imagination to fill. The great changes, of the light and shade prompted him to paint weightless forms unknown to nature: he unlocked a vital energy and creative spirit. Gore’s style of art reflects a powerful surrealistic influence and incorporates countless travel experiences. He paint abstract and semi-abstract forms, weightless in time and space. His art portrays an alternative view of reality, one without borders and limitations.

Alexander’s paintings, which are made with original oil on canvas or original oil on paper only, are immediately recognized by the dominant lines, twisted shapes and subtle colors. He has created a new style of art that he calls “Agorism”, a style based on principle and motivated by surrealistic image.

According to Alexander, the straight line does not exist in nature. The curved line is a basic element of nature. “Only a curved line has a vitality and energy, unknown to non-natural straight line, he says, “I believe, that people’s lives can be changed for the better with both the interior and the exterior , based on the curve line.”

While Alexander Gore’s art has been shown in museums, galleries and auction houses globally, he has gained most renown along the East Coast, appearing in Washington DC, New York and Miami.

A prolific advertising artistic director and later President of William S. Crawford Associates, he began designing carpets in 1932 encouraged by Duncan Miller, who exhibited them in his London gallery and dedicated to Havinden a solo show in 1937. He also designed carpets for Simpson's department store in 1934 and 1935, as well as Edinburgh Weavers (founded in 1928 by James Morton as a progressive branch of the Alexander Morton and Co., a leading mill throughout the Arts & Crafts period). 

'Orpheus', illustrated here, was one of the designs made for the Wilton Royal Carpet Factory. Conceived in his signature style, which he described in 1965 by stating that 'as a result of my experiments with abstract painting, I jumped at the idea of the application of bold brush forms and vivid colours to produce 'swooping' designs for modern rugs.' In his celebration of the Greek mythological figure of Orpheus, Havinden highlights its musical associations by masterfully embellishing a curvilinear motif which appears to derive from the symbol of the key of violin.

The conquest of Alexander the Great in the late 4th century BC it led to the creation of Hellenistic kingdoms on the Mediterranean and in the near east, including Ptolemaic Egypt, and brought Greek religion into close contact with the original religions of those kingdoms. The resulting spread of cultures allowed many religious traditions to spread throughout the Hellenistic world over the course of the last three centuries BC. Before then, cults tied to a particular city or nation were the norm in the ancient world. The new mobile cults, which included those of Isis and Serapis, adapted to different regions and to people who came from many different cultures.[87]

Spread by merchants and other Mediterranean travelers, the cults of Isis and Serapis became established in Greek port cities towards the end of the 4th century BC. and expanded through Greece and Asia Minor during the 3rd and 2nd centuries. The sacred Greek island of Delos was an early center of worship for both gods, and its status as a center of trade made it the point from which Egyptian cults spread to Italy.[88] Isis and Serapis were also venerated at sites throughout the Seleucid Empire, the Hellenistic kingdom in the Middle East that extended east to modern-day Iran, although they disappeared from the region when the Seleucids lost conquered territories to the Parthian kingdom.

The Greeks saw Egyptian religion as exotic and sometimes bizarre, yet full of ancient wisdom.[90] Like other cults of the eastern Mediterranean regions, the cult of Isis attracted the Greeks and Romans, playing on its exotic origins,[91] but the form it took after reaching Greece was extremely Hellenized.[92] Much of this Hellenization was influenced by the cult of Demeter, with which Isis was increasingly compared.

The cult of Isis (Isis) reached Italy and the Roman influential sphere in the 2nd century BC. It was one of many cults that were introduced to Rome as the territories of the Roman Republic expanded in the last few centuries BC. The authorities of the Republic sought to define which cults were acceptable and which were not, attempting to define a Roman cultural identity in the midst of cultural changes brought about by the expansion of Rome. In the case of Isis, temples and altars dedicated to her were built on the Capitoline Hill, in the heart of the city, by private individuals in the early 1st century BC. The independence of her cult from the control of the Roman authorities made it a potential threat. In the 40s and 50s BC, when the crisis of the Republic made the Romans fear that the peace between the gods was crumbling, the Roman Senate destroyed these temples, although they did not completely banish Isis from the city.

The Egyptian cults faced further hostility during the final war of the Roman Republic, when Rome, under the command of Octavian, the future Augustus, fought the Ptolemaic empire of Cleopatra VII. After Octavian's victory, the temples of Isis and Serapis were banished from inside the pomerium, the border of the sacred heart of Rome, allowing their construction in the city but outside the pomerium, making the two Egyptian gods not Roman, but acceptable to Rome. Although they were temporarily expelled from Rome during the reign of Tiberius. Egyptian cults gradually became an accepted part of the Roman religious landscape. The emperors of the Flavian dynasty treated Serapis and Isis as protectors of their kingdom in the same way as traditional Roman deities, such as Jupiter and Minerva. Even as it was integrated into Roman culture, the cult of Isis developed new characteristics that emphasized its Egyptian origins, including a greater emphasis on Osiris than there had been in Hellenistic times.

The cults also expanded into Rome's western provinces, starting on the Mediterranean coast at the beginning of the imperial period. At their peak, in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries AD, Isis and Serapis were venerated in most cities of the western empire, although they were not very present in the countryside. Their temples have been found at Petra and Palmyra, in the provinces of Arabia and Syria, at Italica in Spain, and at Londinium in Brittany. In that period they were considered protectors of the emperor and the well-being of society, at a level comparable to that of the Roman gods.",0

These beautiful ormolu-mounted white marble cassolettes are by Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) and John Fothergill (1730- circa 1782) published in their Pattern Book No. 1 (page 171, figure t) and reproduced in Sir Nicholas Goodison's Ormolu: The Work of Matthew Boulton (New York, 1974, page 383, figure 161).

Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) was a close friend of Boulton's and his patterns are thought to be the source for the medallions used on the plinths of these. Boulton's medallions of classical figures are almost identical to the cameos and intaglios made by Wedgwood and his partner James Tassie.

Molds for these examples can be found in the Wedgwood Collection at the Victoria & Albert Museum. All derive from the same classical source of Renaissance gems. Many gem collections in Europe were widely published at this time and Boulton's library contained A. F. Gori's Museum Florentinum (1731-1766), in which gems from the Medici collection were engraved.

The subjects of the medallions on this pair are: Pomona, a Roman goddess of fruit trees, gardens, and orchards, and depicted carrying a basket on her head overloaded with fruit, tumbling to the ground, shown once on each vase.  Hygeia, once on each, with an olive branch in her right hand, as seen in Tassie's reproduction of Valerio Belli's gem, and holding a snake in her left hand over an altar. This was produced by Wedgwood both as an intaglio and as a cameo.  Venus & Cupid, only on one vase, showing Venus leaning against a column with a pike, and giving a helmet to Cupid. Aesclepius, Greek GD of medicine, only on one vase, depicted with a snake wrapped around his staff .The last medallion subject is either Diomedes or Perseus, shown once on each vase, depicted as a conquering hero.  Boulton asked patrons to choose from a limited repertoire of motifs, and therefore each vase or pair of vases is adorned with their own combination. Boulton used nine medallion subjects on recorded vases of this type.


PROVENANCE & COMPS

Another pair of this model, with slightly less elaborate lids and finials, from a private collection are illustrated in Goodison's Matthew Boulton: ORMOLU, (page 379, figure 153). A further example is in a private New York collection. This pair, which was acquired from Hotspur in 1981, was formerly in the Collection of Marjorie Wiggin Prescott, sold Christie’s, New York, 31 January 1981, lot 76. The Prescott Collection was one of the most important English furniture collections of its time. The sale consisted mostly of late 17th and 18th century English furniture ranging from rare early stumpwork pieces, hangings and other small objects, to some exquisite piece of Georgian walnut and mahogany furniture, including several previously in the Percival Griffiths Collection.  A similar pair sold at Christies Auction 7821 THE BARRATT COLLECTION - FROM CROWE HALL, BATH, for 115,250 British Pounds, equivalent to $180,000 USD.  Another pair sold at Christies Auction, 50 YEARS OF COLLECTING:DECORATIVE ARTS OF GEORGIAN ENGLAND, in 2003, for 201,250 British Pounds, equivalent to $326,025 USD.  These are just a few examples out of many more that demonstrate the magnificent and importance of these museum quality cassolettes.

These tureens show the combination of iconic French and German porcelain trends.  Produced by Meissen under the direction of Marcolini, these tureens come from a period when porcelain production was at its peak. Count Camillo Marcolini became the director of the Meissen Porcelain Factory in 1774. During his tenure domestic German porcelain flourished in popularity when political strife restricted imports from neighboring European countries. Porcelains from this era remain some of the finest and most iconic in history. 

This set of mounted tureens is decorated with hand-painted scenes of townspeople gathering to socialize. Atop the tureen is a seated putto, indicating the joyful leisure present on the tourine’s frieze.  Surrounding the porcelain is a gilt bronze rim, handles, and stand. The porcelain bodies are mounted on ormolu plinths with four lion paws.

The porcelain elements—primarily the painting on the frieze—are distinctly German, while the ormolu elements are French. Utilizing the surface of the porcelain to depict the hum and haw of village people is typical of German painting, which has culturally taken a more democratic approach to artistic provocations. The French elements, on the other hand, are far more ostentatious and opulent. The flashy ormolu mount and lion’s feet solidify the French imperial design sensibilities, while the subtle painted social commentary continues the history of German sociological inquiry.

Step into an era where Meissen porcelain meets French doré bronze in a harmonious blend of artistry and elegance. These 3-light candelabras, each a testament to the skill of their creators, stand as a magnificent display of art and function.

A striking feature of these candelabras is the meticulously handcrafted, fine, multicolored porcelain flowers that appear fresh and vibrant, adorning the ormolu lattice structure. Each delicate petal is attached to the main frame with gilt stems, artfully fashioned in a naturalistic manner. The result is an enchanting arrangement that appears to be growing unhindered from a garden below.

The naturalistic theme extends to the candle holders themselves, with each one adorned with leaves that gracefully wrap around the main body of the candle cup. Below the candle cup, the design continues with doré bronze and hand-carved leaves that fan out in a graceful flourish, not only enhancing the visual appeal but also serving a practical purpose.

What truly sets these candelabras apart is the addition of finely crafted and painted Meissen porcelain figures. Two alluring Meissen women, one with raven-black hair and the other with pale tresses, are captured, their torsos loosely draped in porcelain, meticulously sculpted and hand-painted to resemble fresh floral fabrics.

One of the figures holds newly cut and tied wheat and a scythe, symbolizing the bountiful harvest, while the other cradles a basket brimming with freshly picked flowers, evoking the beauty of nature. Both figures are elegantly elevated as if standing within tall pedestals.

This pair of candelabras is a testament to the level of artistry and attention to detail that characterized the 18th century, where fine Meissen porcelain, intricate ormolu metalwork, and exquisite design converged to create objects of enduring beauty and sophistication.",0

This pair of vases showcase the exquisite ornamentation and detailed craftsmanship of French porcelain manufacturing.  The vases are urn-shaped: featuring a bulbous vessel with a flared mount and neck. Dore bronze textured handles are attached to either side. The vessel itself is a deep cobalt blue, but it is heavily adorned with warm ormolu embellishment. Ormolu decoration frames the center of the vase’s frieze where there is an image of a young couple. In each of the paintings, a noble young woman is being courted by a young man. The two sit beneath a tree on a clear spring day.  This lovers scene is known as a Watteau Lover's scene and was started by Antoine Watteau in the early 1700's.  The double sided paintings are very rare to find as most Sevres vases have only one sided paintings.  The dore bronze quality is also magnificent with hand-chased and hand-chiseled motifs.  Both vases are hand-adorned with heavy raised 24K gilt decoration of exquisite quality.

The dore bronze mounts are truly impressive on this pair of candelabra. Each section of the mounts are hand-chased and hand-chiseled in two-tone matte and burnished gold. The dore bronze tops are acorn finials, which are sandwiched between two rock crystal prisms with acanthus leaf dore bronze holders. Each candelabra body is hand carved and hand-polished from a large and very clear piece of natural rock crystal, which has been mounted to multiple dore bronze candle arms. The long dore bronze arms are very unusual, they swirl from the body to the candle holders and are each burnished and hand-chassed. The candle holders are decorated with wreaths in relief which are matte and burnished creating a 3-dimentional effect to the lights. The bobeches are equally beautiful and are cast in the form of acanthus leaves with grapes which hang off the sides. Decorated on each bobeche are clear rock crystal and amethyst crystals which dangle around the circumference of the bobeches. Dore bronze acanthus leaf arms provide an area where large rock crystal prisms hang and decorate the rest of the candelabra. Each candelabrum is mounted on a gorgeous hand carved and hand-polished banded agate stone base, which sits on 8 dore bronze feet. After examining the incredible quality and craftsmanship of these candelabra, specifically the dore bronze work, we have come to the conclusion that these are attributed to the work of either Alfred Beurdeley, Henry Dasson, or another incredible bronzier of the mid 19th Century.

These extraordinary pieces serve as a testament to the epitome of artistic mastery, meticulously crafted by the esteemed Alfred Beurdeley. They belong to a limited series known as the 'Aux Autruches' collection, named after the original masterpiece designed by the illustrious François Rémond in the 1700s. Emmanuel Alfred Beurdeley, also known as Alfred II (1847-1919), faithfully produced a series of commissioned candelabra featuring enchanting ostrich motifs. It is noteworthy that the original creation from this collection by François Rémond currently resides in the Palace of Versailles. 

The magnificent and rare candelabra showcase intricate hand-chased and hand-chiseled workmanship. Boasting seven candle arms adorned with ormolu foliate motifs, gracefully twisted and embellished with naturalistic acanthus leaves, flowers, and berries. The cups at the ends of the arms are adorned with elaborate banded filigree edged bobeches, radiating timeless beauty and refinement. On the base are half crescent moon's, symbolic of the Turkish crescent moon, as these were made for the Turkish court.

What is truly beautiful are the meticulously hand-chased and hand-chiseled patinated bronze ostriches, which exhibit an astonishing level of detail and life-like appearance. The majestic ostriches exude elegance as they seemingly support the circular ormolu mid flare beneath the primary arms of the candelabra. Their heads are adorned with an openwork ormolu decoration of enchanting tassels and pearls that create a cascading and interlacing effect. They stand resolutely atop a splendid round ormolu plinth accentuated by draperies, bows, stars, and a rush, exuding the distinctive charm of the Louis XVI style. Notably, the ostriches possess a highly coveted patina, while the remaining ormolu elements gleam resplendently. The central ormolu stem showcases delicate striations and is encircled by a spiraling vine motif, further enhancing its allure. Countless flawless details abound, attesting to the masterful artistry employed in their creation. 

François Rémond established himself as one of the finest bronziers, rivaling even his esteemed elder, Thomire. In terms of historical significance, the original ostrich candelabra were initially delivered in 1782 to the second Turkish Cabinet of the Comte d'Artois at Versailles. Subsequently, they were confiscated during the Revolution and preserved by the Temporary Arts Commission in 1794. Later, they were transferred to the Hôtel de l'Infantado in Paris by the end of 1795. Noteworthy mentions include their presence in the Tuileries, the Empress's apartment in 1807, the Grand Cabinet of the Emperor in 1810, the sacristy of the chapel in 1816, the King's waiting room in 1833, and the Salon du Conseil in 1855. After being relocated to the Mobilier National in 1871, they were ultimately placed in the Louvre in 1901 before finding their current residence in Versailles on November 20, 1912. In 1971, they were prominently displayed on the fireplace in the Queen's noble salon, emanating their undeniable grandeur and historical significance.",0

The bold sculptural element of the ormolu base complements the delicate etching on the surface of the crystal. Although subtle against the pristine crystal surface, a group of small birds gather on a branch, overlooking nearby fauna. On the base of the vase are feet made of pine cones and flowers. 

For over 250 years, Baccarat has been a leading producer of luxury furnishings. Since the beginning of their production, Baccarat committed to producing crystal glass tableware of the highest quality. Aiming to bring together the four earthly elements to make their products, etched crystal vases like the ones used on this pair of lamps are an exquisite example of their signature design.

Each vase is of baluster form with a double-crystal overlay, which is methodically hand-diamond-cut with a gorgeous array of colors. The underlayer crystal is white opaline, while the top layer of crystal is cobalt blue opaline.  The two layers of crystal are exceptionally thick and each decorative cut made in them is done by hand with a hand-diamond copper wheel cut.  The tops, body, base are each designed with Royal French decoration with Fleur De Lis adorned in 24K gold decoration embellished all around them.  The gilding work is incredible, with bands of gilt lines, Fleur De Lis, laurel leaves, decorative vines, and arabesque patterns.  Each brushstroke of gilding is hand-matted and hand-burnished with a two-tone design, which is extremely complex to perform on crystal.  The front and back body of each of the vases are also gorgeously elaborate, with hand-enameled designs of floral arrangement; these include, but are not limited to: roses, lilies, chrysanthemum flowers, leaves, vines, lavender, hydrangeas, orchids, wheat, and blossoms. The flower arrangements are made to appear as if they are tied together at the base with a ribbon.  Enameled decoration on opaline crystal is considered one of the most challenging techniques to master in all art.  The hues, brushes, and base ""canvas"" are very tedious to work with and take many hours, and even years to complete single pieces.  These gorgeous vases are both marked on the base with Baccarat and 1866.  One vase has slight rubbing to the underside mark, but that is very normal for gilt decoration on objects that are more than 120 years old.

With a small diameter of bronze at the base, the vase widens as it ascends to the mouth. The inverted conical shape of the glass is supported by bronze handles on opposite sides of the vase. Swans with long, flexible necks bend to form the decorative handles—their bodies descend into ormolu floral decoration and re-attach to the vase towards the bottom.

The hand-diamond cut crystal is faceted into a variety of patterns and shapes to give the surface a textile texture. The middle portion of the crystal is shaped into an extruding diamond pattern that creates an optical illusion when peering through the vase, while the top and bottom of the glass are dimpled with straight and diagonal lines, creating a rope effect surrounding the perimeter.

The set features two sprigs of hyacinth—one with ballet pink petals and another with baby blue. The stem and leaves are painted with dark forest green and attached to the cut glass and ormolu base. Shaped into a rectangular prism, the cut glass vase is textured with vertical pillar flutes. It is sandwiched between the ormolu mouth and base, which are also rectangular in shape and feature geometric ormolu patterning.  These are the best quality of mercury gilt ormolu that were produced.  The gilding of these cachepots is stunning and the hand-chisel and chase work is unmatched. 

Meant to be a delightful, buoyant decoration for interior spaces, Tôle-Peinte enlivens metalwork with bright colors and a delicate luster. Tôle-Peinte is a method of hand-painting on shaped metalware and is typically found on tables and kitchenware.

This ornate, extravagant pair of monumental bronze candelabras exemplify French empire taste and the style of King Louis XVI.  Standing on an ormolu mounted base with a hand-carved crystal stem and elaborate draping arm pieces, the candelabra are both detailed and grandiose. The square base layers ormolu with crystal, and then another addition of an ormolu chalice connecting the stem to the crystal mount. The ormolu fixtures feature acanthus leaves and rooster heads, bringing in two multiple elements of neoclassical imagery to make a display of French imperial taste. 

On the crystal stem, the craftsman carved diamond-shaped facets that cover the entire surface of the material. The pattern gives the candelabra contrasting shapes—orderly rows of quadrilaterals and sprawling floral fixtures. Another curious contrast occurs between the stately appearance of the candelabra with the presence of the rooster heads atop the candle attachments.

Boasting sumptuous French Regency design, this pair of orbs stand atop an intricate, high-relief silvered bronze plinth. The plinths are supported by a tripod of lions’ feet, while the base is decorated by acanthus leaves, shields, curtails, flowerbeds, and three lions’ heads in line with the feet.  The splendid and meticulous plinths present two hand-carved and polished crystal orbs. Their smooth surface complements the complicated fractal interior.

Crystal orbs have been used by the occult since the European Iron Age. Psychics, sorcerers, and shamans drew insights and predictions from orbs as a source of divine knowledge and to receive positive energy. Many pre-industrial cultures practiced crystal gazing throughout history, but the Druids originated what we now associate with crystal balls. After the disappearance of the occult Druids in the 7th century CE, crystal reading fell out of practice in Europe. It was not until interest in paganism and occult knowledge emerged in the Renaissance that crystal orbs resurfaced and gained cultural prominence.

These remarkable candelabra epitomize the artistic splendor of the Louis XVI period. Inspired by the lively scenes of Bacchanalian revelry, the patinated bronze sculptures depict male and female figures captured in dynamic poses. Gracefully half crouched atop elegantly fluted white marble plinths, the sculptures exude an air of classical elegance.  Enhancing the allure of the plinths, delicate ormolu foliate decorations are tastefully arranged in a repeat pattern within the lower sections of each fluted concavity. The plinths' bases extend outward, forming a gently sloped step that is lavishly adorned with ornate ormolu surrounds.  Both male and female subjects are portrayed with a sublime sense of nudity, veiled by the presence of flowing fabrics that delicately drape their figures. In their hands, they carry exquisite ormolu torches that serve as candelabras, adding a touch of refined illumination to any space.  The figures themselves are masterfully crafted from richly patinated bronze, showcasing the utmost attention to detail and artistry.

Engravings of Swedish King Karl X Gustav (b. 1622 - d. 1660) dated 1663 and his successor, King Karl XI (b. 1655 - d. 1697) from 1696 by Samuel Blessendorf, a Prussian enamel painter and engraver, born in Berlin in 1670. He designed and engraved these portraits for Puffendorf’s History of Sweden by Freiherr Samuel von Pufendorf (1632-1694), Historiographer to King Karl X of Sweden.
Freiherr Samuel von Pufendorf (b 1632 – d 1694) was a German jurist, political philosopher, economist and historian. He was born Samuel Pufendorf and ennobled in 1684 when he was made a baron by Charles XI of Sweden a few months before his death at age 62. Among his achievements are his commentaries and revisions of the natural law theories of Thomas Hobbes and Hugo Grotius.
Pufendorf was familiar to American political writers such as Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Thomas Jefferson. His political concepts are part of the cultural background of the American Revolution. Pufendorf is seen as an important precursor of Enlightenment in Germany. He was involved in constant quarrels with clerical circles and frequently had to defend himself against accusations of heresy, despite holding largely traditional Christian views on matters of dogma and doctrine.",0

Each vase is beautifully hand-diamond cut, consisting of an array of crystal motifs designs including starbursts, fan motifs, and crosshatching.

The undersides of the vases are signed, 'Ste Des Onyx H. Journet & Cie / 24 Bd Italiens'. The vases were crafted by Henri Journet, who became the director of a company called ‘Société des marbres d'onyx d'Algérie’ in 1875, taking over from its late founder, Eugène Cornu. Under the new name, H. Journet & Cie, the firm continued to create high-quality centerpieces with Fine ormolu mounts, like this pair of vases.",0

Each vase is of amphora form with a wide upper mouth that extends downwards to a slender neck which rests on a bulbous body.  The color of this crystal is exceptionally rare; Baccarat crystal is one of the most dense crystals manufactured in all of Europe and this blue opaline color is no exception in quality and scarcity.  Opal stones are crushed into the crystal during its manufacturing process and when heated, they emit a gorgeous color into the crystal.  The transparency of this crystal is quite unusual as well with a high opacity, this translates to a larger amount of opal being used to create the crystal for these vases.  The more opal used in the making, the higher the quality and richer the color of the crystal becomes.  More spectacular are all the hand-chased and hand-chiseled ormolu mounts throughout the vases.  Each section is cast with an incredibly difficult open-work design.
The craftsmanship of such mounts involves intricate detailing and high precision. The sphinxes, with their mythical and regal presence, are often depicted with a meticulous attention to anatomical correctness and graceful posture, embodying a blend of strength and elegance. The floral elements and vines are skillfully rendered to create a sense of naturalistic beauty, with delicate petals and curling tendrils that enhance the vases' aesthetic appeal. Trees and maiden masks, included in the mounts, showcase masterful artistry, with the trees possibly featuring textured bark and lifelike branches, while the maiden masks exhibit detailed facial features and refined expressions. Each element is carefully cast and finished, ensuring that the ormolu retains its golden sheen and highlights the artistic details.  The quality of these mounts is further evident in their seamless integration with the vases, enhancing rather than overpowering their design.

Each vase decorated on the front and reverse with Bacchus or Ariadne in a chariot surrounded by scrolling foliage and anthemion beneath a waisted neck enhanced with a Greek key pattern. Each vase is exceptionally hand-carved and second-to-none in quality. Baccarat is the best crystal and glass manufacturer in Europe. These vases truly demonstrate the quality and attention to detail Baccarat emphasizes on their glass. The figures on either side of the vases are exceptionally hand-carved, etched and acid-washed, giving them their beautiful pronounced details. The figures, animals, and chariot demonstrate a three-dimensional tone, with shadows and variable hues to the blue and white areas, which really make the images pop off the surface. To help complete these beautiful masterpieces, Baccarat added 24-karat gilt decoration to the upper and lower sections of each vase.
One single blue vase is featured in the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia.

The deep, rich hue of ox blood gradually transitions to a more translucent tone towards the upper portion, creating an alluring visual effect. These vases boast an angular and generously wide shape, emphasizing their artistic appeal. Reflecting traditional Chinese aesthetics, these stylized vases feature double handles and large ribbing along the midsection, exuding a tasteful and understated elegance. The exceptional coloration of these pieces showcases a darker shade at the base, gradually transitioning to a lighter hue at the top, while the fluted top adds an extra touch of refinement.

The deep red glaze adorning these porcelain vases originates from the use of copper, a notoriously challenging metal to control during the kiln firing process. The distinctive oxblood color emerges when copper is deprived of oxygen in a smoky, oxygen-reduced kiln and subsequently re-oxidizes during the cooling phase. The resulting glaze, characterized by its varying shades and opacities, stands as one of the most unique and elusive manifestations within the realm of high-fire ceramics.",0

These exceptional terracotta figures of two beautiful women are by one of the greatest sculptors of the 18th Century into modern times. The left-most figure, Pomona, resembles Clodion's imagery of standing women figures of the 1780's. These figures generally consist of draped maidens which pull the draperies to the side revealing their skin and bodies, demonstrating promiscuity. This type of artistic approach to terracotta originates from the Hellenistic marble figure of Callipygian Venus as well as Houdon's Frileuse. An identical model of Pomona, as seen to the left, can be found in both Musee des Ursulines, Macon, as well as in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The second terracotta figure, to the right, is also expertly carved and hand-worked, and part of the statuettes subject by Clodion. She is seen bearing fruit in a tunic brought up above her waist. They sit on a pair of faux marble pedestals.

Each with a triangular base and a triform frame with acanthus finial present on the lid, undercarriage of the porphyry, top, and bases. The ormolu supports are cast with a rams head each scrolling gradually to the bottom of the base into hoof feet. The urn-shaped porphyry bodies have removable covers surmounted by ormolu. Each piece is exquisitely hand-carved with exceptional detail present in each ormolu section. These can be easily attributed to the French Maker Beurdeley because of the find hand chasing and quality of the ormolu and the hi-polish of the Porphory.

Porphyry is an exceptionally durable stone, which obtained its antiquity name from its rich red color, that is speckled with white accents. Porphyry is similar to the purple color called purpura by the Romans. Over the course of trade and barter, the name reached the massif where porphyry was quarried in Egypt, where the Romans adopted and called Mons Porphyrites. 
During the first century B.C., the Romans quarried porphyry, using and excavating the stone in such large quantities that it was almost entirely used. The exceptional stone began to be used for monumental reasons, gaining an Imperial Symbol, due to its analogy with Roman purpura, which had been the signified with regal dignity. Porphyry use was limited by Emporer Diocletian to the Imperial family. The onerous task of sculpting masterpieces with this stone has forever been lost, only to see such works of art from past-times.

Gouthiere (1732-1813) was a renowned metal-worker, said to be the carver and gilder to King Louis XVI.",0

F. Caldwell and Co New York. In the Empire style, the circular pierced frieze decorated with swans and anthemia above a ribbon-entwined floral border, on four paw-footed supports, each with a metal plaque engraved Georges A Glaenzer & Co. 1891. These unique torcheres are easily attributable to the NY maker E. F. Caldwell and Co, New York, retailed by Georges A. Glaenzer & Co., New York, dated 1891.

Born in Paris, interior decorator Georges A. Glaenzer (d.1915) was a member of the French Commission at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Returning to the United States in 1880, he worked for such illustrious clientele such as the Vanderbilts and John D. Archbold. In the late 1880s, he contributed his talents to the construction of the Vanderbilt mansion in Hyde Park, New York, joining the ranks of such notables as architect Stanford White and lighting designer Edward F. Caldwell who catered exclusively to America’s elite. The decorator undoubtedly favored the Empire style, having dove-tailed original period furnishings from Napoleon's former château Malmaison with late 19th century replicas in the overall opulent design of the country residence. Between 1891 and 1894, Glaenzer oversaw the interior decoration of the New York townhouse of Joseph A. Taft, again incorporating revival decorations such as these Torcheres, (dated 1891) with those of the great designers and architects who flourished under Napoleon.

Caldwell & Co. was America’s premier producer of lighting and other metal objects during the turn of the 20th century through the 1940s. Notable clients of Caldwell lighting fixtures included the Rockefellers, Carnegies, and Roosevelts, and the company was also commissioned for famous landmarks such as the Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. The White House also has many Caldwell lighting decorations throughout. Caldwell & Co. manufactured unique and intricate lighting fixtures in their Manhattan factory, such as chandeliers, electrified lamps, and wall sconces.",0

The porcelain was made with the finest detail placed on each vase. Each porcelain vase was made in China for Export in the 1800s. The ormolu was later finely cast and hand-chiselled in Paris to be placed on the vases, in the mid-1800s. Each dragon is remarkably casted and detailed to a degree unlike any other. The incredible contrast between the majestic ormolu dragons and ardent hand-painted blue porcelain really brings this piece to new heights, in both aesthetics and quality.

Since the Middle Ages, the city of Limoges in central France thrived on the artistic production of enamel on metal. Similar in composition to glass, enamel consists of silica and a fluxing agent colored by metallic oxide or carbonate and fused to a metal surface by heat. From the twelfth through the fifteenth century, Limoges enamel painters gouged into the surface of the metal (champlevé) or raised thin dams between areas of color (cloisonné) to establish the design and to prevent pigments from mixing. By the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries, materials and techniques developed that permitted painters to apply enamels more freely to copper surfaces, without obvious demarcations between areas of color, in a manner that approached the painting of oil on paint or canvas. Unlike oil painting, enameled metal retains its hue without fading, or tel que l’ambre une fleur (like a flower in amber), as the poet Théophile Gautier wrote in a sonnet to the nineteenth-century enamel painter Claudius Popelin.

This technical development paralleled the growing cult of antiquity in France and the widespread circulation of printed images. While religious themes had dominated Limoges enamels in the Middle Ages and continued to cover the surfaces of Limoges plaques particularly in the first third of the sixteenth century, images of Greek and Roman subjects, readily available to painters through engravings and woodcuts, predominated from the 1530s.

Each mirrored sconce is of octagonal form with a beautiful antique, original, mirrored backing on a dore bronze mounted frame. The dore bronze frame's border is very elaborately decorated with hand-chased and hand-chiseled designs of small octagonal frames, which are similar to the actual form of the sconces. The dore bronze arms are of armorial design and originate from the open mouth of a lion. They are all beautifully hand-chased and hand-chiseled with tremendous detail. The dore bronze mounts are all burnished and matted creating a three-dimensional pattern for the sconces. They are further decorated with flags, arrows, axes, and various vines and leaves. Sconces of this quality and craftsmanship are especially rare and were most probably made by the great Pierre-Philippe Thomire, one of the best bronziers during the Empire period.

The chenets feature a stately dark patina bronze sphynx body on top of a decorated bronze dark patina table with Gilt Bronze decoration and golden legs. The sphynxes are finely detailed, with intricate carvings and engravings that showcase the skilled craftsmanship of the French designers of the Early 1800s Empire Period.

The Egyptian Revival style popular in the 19th century was inspired by the artifacts and designs of ancient Egypt. The use of the sphynx as a decorative element was a common motif in this style, and these chenets are a beautiful example of this trend.

In excellent condition, these chenets are a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the French designers of the 19th century. They would make a stunning addition to any home, particularly those with traditional or antique décor. True works of art, the chenets will be treasured for generations to come.",0

This exceptional pair of Louis XVI style porcelain vases are beautifully handcrafted and perched on ormolu-mounted bases, designed with a round base decorated with tender acanthus leaves around the rim of the base. Juxtaposed by a magnificently modeled and hand engraved Chinese export porcelain which was then all hand-painted with exquisite brush strokes and precision. The ormolu handles present prepossessing maidens holding up each handle with vine-like tails extending from their feet.
Hercules masks are decorated at the end of each spout located atop the ormolu. The magnificent porcelain has delicately hand modeled and engraved cranes and clouds, which signify longevity and peacefulness. As the prince of all feathered creatures, cranes hold a high stature in the animal kingdom, which represent the importance of these vases. The clouds drawn throughout the porcelain towards the heavens represent good luck and great fortune. This comes from the Chinese word ""Yun"" meaning luck, which also means clouds, but is pronounced slightly differently. The porcelain was made with the finest detail placed on each vase. Each porcelain vase was made in China for export in the late 1700s-early 1800s. The ormolu was later finely cast and hand-chiseled in Paris to be placed on the vases, in the early to mid 1800s. The incredible contrast between the majestic ormolu maidens and ardent hand-painted blue porcelain with cranes and clouds really brings this piece to new heights, in both aesthetics and quality, circa 1830-1850.",0

The lamps are fashioned in the neoclassical style and feature a brightly-contrasted yellow and brown marbling. Atop the solid dark brown plinths stand urn-shaped vessels—a staple in French Empire lamp design.  This curious urn shape was a staple in French empire homes—considered a stately addition to any interior design scheme. The swirling yellow and brown marble is complemented by the crisp white adornment, black wood plinths, and solid bronze stem. On either side of the urn is a woman’s head attaching the handle to the lamp. Her face is rendered in a style evocative of Greco-Roman sculptural practices. Beside her drapes two faux wreaths: another reference to neoclassical sensibility.

TRASFORMATIO
Design Non Convenzionale
TRASFORMATIO is a design line born from the collaboration between the artist Michele Iodice and the Esprit Nouveau Gallery in Naples.
Alberta Saladino, founder and soul of Esprit Nouveau Gallery, has been proactively involved in ‘900 antique pieces research during the last twenty years and invited Michele Iodice to think of a way to reinterpret some Art Deco complementary design and furnishing pieces, from her private collection.
TRASFORMATIO project has a pioneer and artistic soul able to set the connection lines between past, present and future.
The whole idea was born with the aim to explore interactions between art and design.
TRASFORMATIO traces an historical path in human minds, that starts with the birth of design and reaches our living present, embracing artistic novelties with wisdom.
The common thread of the exhibition is dynamism.
“Most of the people think a furnishing piece can only be a set of elements that move in the emptiness of space. Nevertheless, for others it can be poetry”.
Alexander Calder described his most successful pieces of work with the above words.
Michele Iodice, fully interprets his thought through TRASFORMATIO. His art works are fluctuating in a dynamic equilibrium where they are able to break the physical limits of traditional static furniture, attributing them movement and lightness.
TRASFORMATIO artistic methods can be applied to every kind of support.
It does not reproduce, but it tears the item out of its traditional context to revive it, instead, in a completely different and new environment.
The setup personally curated by the Neapolitan artist, combines a collection of pieces that express the close relationship between design and contemporary art, as well as the strong connection between cultural stratification and innovation.

TRASFORMATIO
Design Non Convenzionale
TRASFORMATIO is a design line born from the collaboration between the artist Michele Iodice and the Esprit Nouveau Gallery in Naples.
Alberta Saladino, founder and soul of Esprit Nouveau Gallery, has been proactively involved in ‘900 antique pieces research during the last twenty years and invited Michele Iodice to think of a way to reinterpret some Art Deco complementary design and furnishing pieces, from her private collection.
TRASFORMATIO project has a pioneer and artistic soul able to set the connection lines between past, present and future.
The whole idea was born with the aim to explore interactions between art and design.
TRASFORMATIO traces an historical path in human minds, that starts with the birth of design and reaches our living present, embracing artistic novelties with wisdom.
The common thread of the exhibition is dynamism.
“Most of the people think a furnishing piece can only be a set of elements that move in the emptiness of space. Nevertheless, for others it can be poetry”.
Alexander Calder described his most successful pieces of work with the above words.
Michele Iodice, fully interprets his thought through TRASFORMATIO. His art works are fluctuating in a dynamic equilibrium where they are able to break the physical limits of traditional static furniture, attributing them movement and lightness.
TRASFORMATIO artistic methods can be applied to every kind of support.
It does not reproduce, but it tears the item out of its traditional context to revive it, instead, in a completely different and new environment.
The setup personally curated by the Neapolitan artist, combines a collection of pieces that express the close relationship between design and contemporary art, as well as the strong connection between cultural stratification and innovation.
Every object signed by Michele Iodice is rigorously realized by local artisans and tells about the attention to detail behind it, in a process that enhances the principles and values of “artigianato cosciente”, in English, “conscious craftsmanship”.

The long neck of the vase is adorned with smaller panels on other sides, one displaying a mesmerizing twisted translucent emerald green dragon, a symbol of power and good fortune in Japanese culture. The neck is also lavishly embellished with detailed stylized foliate, showcasing a remarkable display of two-toned 24K gold detailing, further adding to its allure. Tied rolled scrolls are tastefully incorporated in various areas, adding an interesting touch to the overall design.

The main stout body is thoughtfully divided by a top and bottom border in blue and white, the lower border adopting a captivating geometric style. Upon rotating the vase, the stout body reveals small panels featuring cranes in flight over beautiful mint green stylized seas, reinforcing the theme of harmony and longevity that is so prevalent in Japanese art. The red rust background between these panels is skillfully adorned with stylized feathers and foliage, elegantly showcased in lovely tones of gold and peach with white highlights.

He looked forward to a life of pleasure and responsibility as well as a large and diversified fortune. (The local coalmines were one source of income.) There were the conventional milestones: Oxford, the grand tour, and Parliament. He was also a member of the Privy Council and a trustee of the British Museum.

One of the most extraordinary episodes in this life was his appointment as ambassador to Russia during the Napoleonic Wars. He was in his late thirties and had not yet come into his inheritance (his father lived until 1819). He was a questionable choice to represent King George III, given his fanciful assertions about being the true heir to the Scottish throne and his outspoken support for Napoleon. But he possessed the wealth necessary for the largely self-financed expedition. He set off in 1807 for the imperial court in St Petersburg with a silver service comprising nearly 300 pieces that had been commissioned from Rundell Bridge with everything necessary in the event Catherine the Great came to dinner. His embassy lasted a mere six months, during which time he added to his art collection and got up to all sorts of milord-abroad foolishness, like trying to wed a forty-something courtesan and Russian agent.

Back home, Hamilton added to the ambassadorial service. This platter, which was made the year he returned from St Petersburg, is engraved with the Hamilton arms. If he was no longer expected to entertain Russian boyars, he still had to maintain standards, especially after he made a suitable marriage to the daughter of William Beckford, who was one of the richest men in England, with a fortune based on the Jamaican sugar harvest. To the Hamilton coalmines were joined the Beckford slave plantations.

The silver service stayed in the Hamilton family until 1919, when it was sold at auction. The largest part was donated to the White House in 1963, during the Kennedy Administration, when First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy undertook the White House renovation.

It was considered the second phase of Neoclassicism, as Napoleon believed that his only peers were rulers of ancient civilizations (Caesar, Alexander the Great, etc.) and that furnishings should be adorned with images representing their dynasties. This patinated and gilt bronze fireplace fender dates to the end of the Empire period, circa 1815, and features iconography associated with Greek and Roman mythology.

A pair of distinguished cherubs kneels atop a highly stepped gilt entablature on each end; these winged figures, which have a dark brown patination, represent Cupid, as one holds a flaming heart, while the other is equipped with a quiver of arrows and his bow at his feet. Beneath each capital (also gilded) is a pedestal embellished with a pair of swans holding the ribbon ends of a floral swag that drops beneath their stylized foliate tails. Two more gold swans can be seen gracing a pair of S-scrolls that run along the top of the transom, connecting the two pedestal ends. These birds have more elaborate foliate tails, with a huge rinceau enveloping a lion mascaron central whorl and a leafy margent tied around their necks. In between these two beautiful scrolls is a cylindrical rod with pinecone terminals that is elevated above the transom by two rising leaf cups. The front of the transom has a golden central floret flanked by two foliate margents. Fenders, such as our Empire gilt bronze example, have been used for centuries, designed not only to decorate the fireplace opening, but to help prevent logs from spilling out into the room.",0

These tables are part of the Etruscan Series, each featuring three dynamic flanges extending from the bronze support columns, meeting with the round base and underneath the tops, leaving cut out sections of negative space allowing for the passage of light and sculptural variation when viewed from different vantage points. The top is surrounded with a band of Patinated Bronze and Silvered Pewter. This patination is achieved uniformly over the surface of the piece by burying the pieces in earth, allowing for the bronze to chemically react in the most primal way possible, anchoring the tables materially to the historic and artistic references they draw upon in their designs and motifs. The surface of the table features a scene after the work of Picasso, a historical figure which Picasso and other artists have long explored as subject matter in order to explore narrative and bring contemporary understanding to ancient processes and divine actors.  The tops of each are signed Philip and Kelvin Laverne.

The top of the porcelain is decorated with a dore bronze acorn finial wrapped in dore bronze acanthus leaves. The underside of the porcelain is decorated with a circular dore bronze mount, and protruding from the mount is a flame finial. Found on the base is an incredible miniature dore bronze urn-style finial, exceptionally decorated with three lions paw legs, garlands, acanthus leaves and an acorn finial. Each piece rests on a hand-carved gorgeous onyx base exemplifying this pieces importance and beauty. Pieces in this size and quality were usually commissioned to Sevres by the king himself.

Each vase consists of multiple large cartouche panels, each with symbolic Chinese decorations.  Underneath and above the large cartouches are smaller cartouches which include decorations of birds, as well as other symbolic Chinese decorations.  Within the space, there are finely detailed images of decorative vases.  The top and base have incredible French hand-chased and hand-chiseled ormolu mounts of the most incredible quality, with laurel wreaths, and Greek key-scroll feet.  Vases of this size, quality, condition, age, and color palette are extremely desirable and very difficult to find.

Each depicted on horseback, Fame is on the left hand side seen wearing a laurel leaf crown and Mercury is seen on the right wearing a helmet, each on naturalistically cast bases. The workmanship of this pair is absolutely superb with incredible casting, hand-chased elements, and a marvelous patina. Each piece is atop a lucite plinth. 
 Antoine Coysevox's colossal marble equestrian groups of Fame and Mercury were executed between 1701 and 1702 during the reign of Louis XIV and were originally commissioned to adorn the ornamental horse pond at Marly. In 1719, however, they were replaced with Guillaume Coustou's horses and subsequently moved to the entrance of the Tulieries gardens in Paris.

Each mirror is gorgeously hand carved with meticulous detail and fine craftsmanship. The giltwood borders are designed with foliate crests above female masks, with aprons centered by a standing or recumbent left facing lamb. It is extremely rare to find a pair of mirrors of this date and in such amazing untouched condition, the mirror panels are most probably original and date to the late 1700s.
Provenance: Jeremy, Ltd., London
England, circa 1770
Carton-pierre, literal translation from the French - cardboard stone, was developed in the 18th century specifically to imitate wood and stone. The Formula typically included flour, chalk, sawdust, sand and plaster and bound with wax, resin, animal glues or gum arabic. The material could be moulded, bent and otherwise formed into the desired design. Preeminent makers like Gillows and John Linnell began using carton pierre in the late 1760s. The new material allowed for lacey decorative spandrels and festoons that could be made into nearly any length or shape required. These elements and the particular foliate umbrella canopy on this pair of mirrors relates to designs of William and John Linnell. The most famous example of this crest element is on the mirror supplied by Linnell to the 4th Duke of Beaufort for the State Bedroom at Badminton House, sold from the Doris Duke Collection, Christie's New York, 3-5 June 2004, lot 442.
Linnell studied Rococo design, particularly by French exponents of the style, at St. Martin’s Lane Academy, founded by William Hogarth in 1735 (ed. G. Beard & C. Gilbert, Dictionary of English Furniture Makers 1660-1840, Leeds, 1986, p. 543). From an early age, he was inspired by the ‘antique’ taste promoted by the fashionable architect Robert Adam (1728-1792), with whom John Linnell and his father William worked on early commissions, including for the 6th Earl of Coventry at Croome Court, Worcestershire and Coventry House, Piccadilly from 1751-1763, and for Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Scarsdale at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire and London from 1759 (ibid., p. 547; H. Hayward, P. Kirkham, William and John Linnell, London, 1980, pp. 108-113).",0

Althorp History 

Althorp (popularly pronounced /'??l???rp/ AWL-thorp) is a Grade I listed stately home and estate in the civil parish of Althorp, in West Northamptonshire, England of about 13,000 acres (5,300 ha). By road it is about 6 miles (9.7 km) northwest of the county town of Northampton and about 75 miles (121 km) northwest of central London, situated between the villages of Great Brington and Harlestone. It has been held by the prominent aristocratic Spencer family for more than 500 years, and has been owned by Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer since 1992. It was also the home of Lady Diana Spencer (later Princess of Wales) from her parents' divorce until her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales.

Althorp is mentioned as a small hamlet in the Domesday Book as ""Olletorp"", and by 1377 it had become a village with a population of more than fifty people. By 1505 there were no longer any tenants living there, and in 1508, John Spencer purchased Althorp estate with the funds generated from his family's sheep-rearing business. Althorp became one of the prominent stately homes in England. The palace dates to 1688, replacing an earlier house that was once visited by Charles I. The Spencer family amassed an extensive art collection and other valuable household items. During the 18th century, the house became a major cultural hub in England, and parties were regularly held, attracting many prominent members of Great Britain's ruling class. George John, 2nd Earl Spencer, who owned Althorp between 1783 and his death in 1834, developed one of the largest private libraries in Europe at the palace, which grew to over 100,000 books by the 1830s. After falling on hard times, John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, known as the Red Earl, in 1892 sold much of the collection to Enriqueta Rylands, who was building the University of Manchester Library. Many of Althorp's furnishings were sold off during the twentieth century, and between 1975 and 1992 alone approximately 20% of the contents were auctioned.

The house at Althorp was a ""classically beautiful"" red brick Tudor building, but its appearance was radically altered, starting in 1788, when the architect Henry Holland was commissioned to make extensive changes. Mathematical tiles were added to the exterior, encasing the brick, and four Corinthian pilasters were added to the front. The grand hall entrance to the house, Wootton Hall, was cited by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as ""the noblest Georgian room in the county"". The Great Dining Room in the east wing extension of the house was added in 1877 to designs by John Macvicar Anderson, its walls hung with faded, red damask silk. Numerous fireplaces and furnishings were brought to Althorp from Spencer House in London during the Blitz for safekeeping and still remain. The Picture Gallery stretches for 115 feet (35 m) on the first floor of the west wing, and is one of the best remaining examples of the original Tudor oak woodwork and ambiance in the mansion. It has an extensive collection of portraits, including Anthony van Dyck's War and Peace, a John de Critz portrait of James I, a Mary Beale portrait of Charles II, and many others. Some £2 million was spent on redecorating the palace in the 1980s, during which time most of the religious paintings of Althorp were sold off.

In total, the grounds of Althorp estate contain 28 listed buildings and structures, including nine planting stones. The former falconry, now a Grade I listed building, was built in 1613. Gardener's House is listed as a Grade II* listed building in its own right, as are the Grade II listed West and East Lodges. The mustard-yellow Grade II listed Stable Block, designed by architect Roger Morris with a Palladian influence, was ordered by Charles, Fifth Earl of Sutherland in the early 1730s. The French landscape architect André Le Nôtre was commissioned to lay out the park and grounds in the 1660s, and further alterations were made during the late 18th century under Henry Holland. Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, she was interred on a small island in the middle of the ornamental Round Oval lake. A Doric-style temple with Diana's name inscribed on top, situated across from the lake, is a tourist attraction during July and August when the house and estate are open to the public, although the exhibition centre, situated in the old stable block, closed permanently in 2013."

Printed in sepia ink on coarse, white linen, this patriotic kerchief shows a standing portrait of George Washington, above which is a swag valance and the words “The Effect of Principle, Behold the Man”. The portrait is based on a mezzotint after Gilbert Stuart’s very famous painting of Washington in his later years. Stuart painted it in oil on canvas for a wealthy merchant by the name of William Constable, who commissioned the work for Alexander Hamilton.

The kerchief is interesting because it is both American-made and documented. This is exceptionally unusual for any printed textile of the 19th century or prior and the earlier the time period the more unlikely an object is to be identified. This kerchief and a companion piece entitled “The Love of Truth Mark the Boy” (also glorifying Washington through the fabled story of the cherry tree), were made ca 1806 by Germantown Print Works in Germantown, Pennsylvania.

To the left of Washington's image is a portion of his infamous farewell address to his troops at the end of the Revolutionary War. To the right is a short excerpt from his eulogy. Below these are three images. In the center is a square-rigged tall ship with “Commercial Union” above it, flanked by the American eagle on the left and the British lion on the right. It is reasonable to assume that the textile may have been produced in demonstration of the maker's desire, and/or that of others, to advance trade with England. Commercial printers were very influential in early America, as they possessed the means by which to disseminate information.

This kerchief and its companion piece are documented in Threads of History, Americana Recorded on Cloth, 1775 - the Present, by Herbert Ridgeway Collins (1979, Smithsonian Press), p. 63, items 38 & 39. The two pieces pictured are in the collection of Cornell University, but the Collins text also cites an uncut pair to be present in the collection of the Western Reserve Historical Society, Cleveland, OH. The name ""Germantown Print Works"" is printed on the Western Reserve examples. Another example of the textile in question is documented in ""Running for President, The Candidates and Their Images, 1789-1896"" by Schlesinger, Israel, and Frendt, (1994, Simon & Schuster), p. 15.

I have seen three different color variations of this textile, including sepia, mulberry red, and blue. This particular example has a hand-sewn binding along the top edge.

Mounting: The gilded American molding is an excellent example and is circa 1820. The kerchief has been hand-stitched to 100% cotton, black in color. The background fabric was washed to reduce excess pigment. An acid-free, pigment-setting agent was added to the wash to further set the pigment and the fabric was heat-treated for the same purpose. Spacers keep the textile away from the glazing, which is U.V. protective glass.

Condition: There is moderate foxing and staining.",0

Antique French 950 Sterling Silver Tea Set by the World's Premier French Silversmiths ""Emile Puiforcat"" (Currently Owned by Hermes) and ""Christofle"", plus 6 Faberge Imperial Egg Collection Espresso Cups & Saucers and a Candy Dish in Limoges Porcelain, An Ultra Luxurious Addition to any Stately Home and Absolutely Magnificent, circa late 1890s.

The French silversmiths Christofle (formerly known as Cardeilhac), and Puiforcat (currently owned by Hermes) stand as prominent figures in the history of silver craftsmanship. With a legacy that spans over two centuries, the firms have been synonymous with excellence in silverware, catering to the needs of French royalty, the elite, and connoisseurs of fine craftsmanship worldwide.  Carl Fabergé also a name synonymous with unparalleled craftsmanship and opulent artistry, stands as a luminary figure in the world of jewelry design.

The House of Puiforcat was founded in 1820 by Emile Puiforcat, a visionary silversmith who sought to redefine traditional craftsmanship with a modern perspective. The brand quickly gained recognition for its commitment to exceptional quality and its avant-garde designs that pushed the boundaries of silversmithing. In its early years, Puiforcat became a favored choice for French aristocracy and European nobility, solidifying its reputation as a leading silverware manufacturer.

The history of Christofle (Cardeilhac) traces its roots to the early 19th century. In 1830, Charles Christofle, a jeweler from Paris, joined forces with Antoine Cardeilhac, a talented silversmith, to form a partnership that would later become one of the most celebrated names in silverware. Initially named Cardeilhac, the company quickly gained recognition for its exceptional craftsmanship and commitment to quality. One of the factors that contributed significantly to the success of Cardeilhac was its early association with French royalty. In 1842, the company received the prestigious title of ""Fournisseur de l'Empereur"" (Supplier to the Emperor) under Napoleon III. This royal patronage not only elevated Cardeilhac's reputation but also provided access to a wealthy and influential clientele.

 The House of Fabergé traces its roots to the early 19th century when Gustav Fabergé, a skilled jeweler of French descent, founded the family business in St. Petersburg. His son, Carl Fabergé, took over the firm in 1872 and began to shape its destiny. Under Carl's visionary leadership, the House of Fabergé quickly gained prominence for its exceptional craftsmanship and innovative designs, becoming the jeweler of choice for the Russian imperial family.  The pinnacle of Carl Fabergé's artistic expression lies in the Imperial Eggs, a series of 50 ornate Easter eggs commissioned by the Russian imperial family between 1885 and 1917. These eggs, often referred to as the ""Fabergé Eggs,"" are unparalleled masterpieces that blend intricate craftsmanship with symbolic storytelling.  Each Imperial Egg is a triumph of creativity and technical prowess, featuring a unique design and concealing a surprise or ""objet d'art"" within.

The Imperial Eggs not only captivated the imperial family but also garnered international admiration from European royalty and affluent collectors, further solidifying the House of Fabergé as a symbol of unparalleled craftsmanship and luxury. The eggs became coveted treasures, with some finding their way into private collections and museums worldwide. The 4 Faberge Egg espresso cups and saucers in fine Limoges porcelain accompanying this exquisite tea set present 4 different egg patterns.

This set includes a teapot, coffee pot, sugar bowl and cream pitcher in 950 sterling silver in addition to 4 Faberge Egg espresso cups and saucers and one candy dish in fine Limoges porcelain.

The Ronson lighter company

The company started as The Art Metal Works in 1897 and was incorporated on July 20, 1898, by Max Hecht, Louis Vincent Aronson and Leopold Herzig, in Newark, New Jersey. Louis V. Aronson was a huge creative driving force for the company; and, with a few business adjustments, including the addition of Alexander Harris (1910–11) as Business Manager, the company soon became World Famous. In the 1910s The Art Metal Works were producing very good quality Hood Ornaments and gained a reputation as a dependable supplier of same. All accounts state that Louis Aronson was a gifted man, who at 16 years old set up a money-making shop in his parent's home - before receiving a U.S. patent for a commercially valuable metal-plating process he developed when he was 24 years old, and he sold half the rights while retaining the Right to Use. ""His experiments, which he has been conducting since his early youth, resulted in 1893 in the discovery of a process for electrically producing tinplate. Much money was expended upon improving the process... and has been of great practical value to the whole industry.

Each of campana form painted in the 'majolica-style' with two leaf-shaped scroll handles terminating in swirls.  The first vase on the right painted around the bowl with a continuous scene of the Bath of Venus with female attendants and Cupid on one side, a pair of lovers with cherubs, a pair of tied doves, Venus seated on a sofa holding a lyre, she is wearing a robe with touches of gilding, all below a narrow band of cherubs and birds on a blue ground, the lower section painted and gilt with scroll above a waisted stem with octagonal 'jewels', the domed foot with a frieze of cherubs, putti and a variety of large wild cats and animals.  The second vase, on the left, is equally as impressive.  With hand-painted scenes of mythological stories which include dragons, serpents, horse drawn chariots with Roman G-D's on them, and many more absolutely incredible masterpieces scenes.  The base and top of the second vase is also fully decorated and further gilt with 24k gold decoration.  Each vase is signed on the bottom with Meissen underglaze blue crossed swords mark.  They are also marked with pressnumber and incised marks.  
These are some of the most incredible, important, and rare pieces of Meissen Porcelain to ever be made by the factory since 1710.  The amount of detail and quality of craftsmanship is incomparable to almost another piece we have in our collection, or even pieces we have seen in other collections around the world.  Meissen porcelain is considered the best European porcelain that exists, and these are no exception.  When you see these vases in person, you will be astonished as to how incredible the scenes are, the painting, the gilding and everything in between.

Nephrite is one of the two distinct minerals commonly known as jade. Nephrite is derived from lapis nephriticus (Latin for ""stone of the kidneys""), for the traditional belief in its power to heal the kidneys and body.  This vase, dating back to the 18th century, is an exceptional representation of the artistry of its time. 18th/19th century jade pieces of this quality and rarity are indeed a remarkable find, attesting to the exquisite craftsmanship and artistic finesse of the era.
Crafted from nephrite spinach jade, this vase is a treasure in itself. Its narrow, arrow-shaped top is adorned with hand-carved leaves, adding a touch of botanical elegance to the piece. The body of the vase features intricate, high-relief floral decorations that further elevate its visual appeal. The level of detail achieved in this hand-carved design reflects the skilled hands that brought this jade masterpiece to life.
The original carved wood base adds to the charm of this vase. Meticulously hand-carved with open-work and a pierced design, the base not only provides a stable foundation for the vase but also serves as a work of art in its own right. This exceptional combination of nephrite spinach jade and a finely crafted wood base makes this vase a unique and remarkable piece that showcases the delicate artistry of 18th-century Chinese craftsmanship.  This piece is from an important collection or museum and has inventory numbers on both the vase and the base.

American, 1860-1950

""Princeton Tiger"" (1910)

Dark-brown and autumnal patinated bronze  signed in cast ""AP PROCTOR 1912"", ""GORHAM CO FOUNDERS 0454 7"" with copyright symbol captured from underlying mold, ""79"" and ""PRINCETON TIGER"" to raised edge  cast circa 1912  formerly with Graham Gallery of New York (label affixed to underside)

Item # 402KMP14C

A very early casting from Alexander Phimster Proctor of his ""Princeton Tiger"". Modeled in 1908-1910, the original monumental pair of these were cast in 1910 and presented to Princeton University Art Museum by the class of 1879 (hence the '79 incised on the front raised edge). They were subsequently cast by Gorham starting in 1912 in two","- 22 3/16"" in total width and 9"" in total width. The present example is the latter dimension and is cold-stamped ""7"", noting its very early production. It is finished in a nearly black overall patination that was relieved to show autumnal hues throughout, the tones together emphasizing the surface texture that is captured directly from the early mold. Note the extraordinary surface nuance and exquisite detail. The underside retains a label from Graham Gallery and shows remnants of the core material loosely moving within the void.

Robinson Crusoe Island, formerly known as Más a Tierra, is the second largest of the Juan Fernández Islands. From 1704 to 1709, the island was home to the marooned sailor Alexander Selkirk, who at least partially inspired novelist Daniel Defoe's fictional Robinson Crusoe in his 1719 novel, although the novel is explicitly set in the Caribbean. 

This was just one of several survival stories from the period of which Defoe would have been aware. To reflect the literary lore associated with the island and attract tourists, the Chilean government renamed the place Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966.

Old bird print depicting Xantus's Murrlets. This print originates from 'The new and heretofore unfigured species of the birds of North America', published 1866-1869.

This spectacular large folio lithograph is from Daniel Giraud Elliot's The New and Heretofore Unfigured Species of the Birds of North America. The work was published in New York for the author between 1866 and 1869. Each lithograph features original hand-coloring. The plates were predmoninantly executed by Bowen of Philadelphia after originals by Elliot and celebrated natural history artist, Joseph Wolf. It is believed only 200 copies of this work were ever printed. 

The work generally depicted life-size renderings of birds that were not previously illustrated by Alexander Wilson or John James Audubon. It had a particular focus on birds of the American West including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. It also depicts some birds from the Alaskand and Arctic regions. Many of birds were drawn from birds brought back from government-led expeditions in the West as well as private sources including John Xantus de Vesey. 

Elliot’s lithographs are some of the most valuable American bird plates. Elliot was a prominent American zoologist. He was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the American Ornithologists’ Union. Elliot was also curator of zoology at Chicago’s Field Museum. 

In the preface, Elliot describes his intentions for the work: ""Since the time of Wilson and Audubon, no work has been published upon American Ornithology, containing life-size representations of the various species that have been discovered since the labors of those great men were finished. The valuable productions of Cassin, as well as the revised edition of the ninth volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, the joint labor of Messrs. Baird, Cassin and Lawrence had indeed appeared . but no attempt had been made to continue the works of the first great American naturalists in a similar manner . It was, therefore, with the desire to contribute . towards the elucidation of the comparatively little known species of the Birds of North America, their habits and economy, as well as to render their forms familiar so far as life-size representation of them might serve to do, that I undertook the present publication.""

William Samuel Henry LLEWELLYN (1858-1941)

Sir (Samuel Henry) William Llewellyn (1858-1941) was a noted and important English painter of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and served as President of the Royal Academy from 1928 to 1938, and was awarded the Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts) in 1933.

Llewellyn has 67 paintings in British national collections, including a portrait of industrialist and philanthropist Sir Alexander Grant held by the University of Edinburgh.

A student of Sir Edward Poynter, (whom he later succeeded as the President of the Royal Academy), and later, in France, under the direction of Jules Joseph Lefebvre, (member of the Legion d'honneur, and a leading light in the Academie des Beaux-Arts, and painting professor at the Academie Julian); Sir Samuel Llewellyn worked in the broad brush plein air manner in the French countryside, especially in Brittany, with the women (Les Lavandieres) depicted being shown in regional Breton costumes.

Returning to England, he worked with the Newlyn School artists colony; his early exhibited works, around the date of our painting include prosaic life views of the locals of St Ives and Newlyn. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1884 onwards in a more conservative manner from the early 1900's as a portraitist, his subjects including Queen Mary (1912), a gift from Queen Mary to King George V, now in the Royal Collection Trust.

This spectacular large folio lithograph is from Daniel Giraud Elliot's The New and Heretofore Unfigured Species of the Birds of North America. The work was published in New York for the author between 1866 and 1869. Each lithograph features original hand-coloring. The plates were predmoninantly executed by Bowen of Philadelphia after originals by Elliot and celebrated natural history artist, Joseph Wolf. It is believed only 200 copies of this work were ever printed. 

The work generally depicted life-size renderings of birds that were not previously illustrated by Alexander Wilson or John James Audubon. It had a particular focus on birds of the American West including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. It also depicts some birds from the Alaskand and Arctic regions. Many of birds were drawn from birds brought back from government-led expeditions in the West as well as private sources including John Xantus de Vesey. 

Elliot’s lithographs are some of the most valuable American bird plates. Elliot was a prominent American zoologist. He was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the American Ornithologists’ Union. Elliot was also curator of zoology at Chicago’s Field Museum. 

In the preface, Elliot describes his intentions for the work: ""Since the time of Wilson and Audubon, no work has been published upon American Ornithology, containing life-size representations of the various species that have been discovered since the labors of those great men were finished. The valuable productions of Cassin, as well as the revised edition of the ninth volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, the joint labor of Messrs. Baird, Cassin and Lawrence had indeed appeared . but no attempt had been made to continue the works of the first great American naturalists in a similar manner . It was, therefore, with the desire to contribute . towards the elucidation of the comparatively little known species of the Birds of North America, their habits and economy, as well as to render their forms familiar so far as life-size representation of them might serve to do, that I undertook the present publication.""

Althorp history

Althorp (popularly pronounced /'??l???rp/ AWL-thorp) is a Grade I listed stately home and estate in the civil parish of Althorp, in West Northamptonshire, England of about 13,000 acres (5,300 ha). By road it is about 6 miles (9.7 km) northwest of the county town of Northampton and about 75 miles (121 km) northwest of central London, situated between the villages of Great Brington and Harlestone. It has been held by the prominent aristocratic Spencer family for more than 500 years, and has been owned by Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer since 1992. It was also the home of Lady Diana Spencer (later Princess of Wales) from her parents' divorce until her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales.

Althorp is mentioned as a small hamlet in the Domesday Book as ""Olletorp"", and by 1377 it had become a village with a population of more than fifty people. By 1505 there were no longer any tenants living there, and in 1508, John Spencer purchased Althorp estate with the funds generated from his family's sheep-rearing business. Althorp became one of the prominent stately homes in England. The palace dates to 1688, replacing an earlier house that was once visited by Charles I. The Spencer family amassed an extensive art collection and other valuable household items. During the 18th century, the house became a major cultural hub in England, and parties were regularly held, attracting many prominent members of Great Britain's ruling class. George John, 2nd Earl Spencer, who owned Althorp between 1783 and his death in 1834, developed one of the largest private libraries in Europe at the palace, which grew to over 100,000 books by the 1830s. After falling on hard times, John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, known as the Red Earl, in 1892 sold much of the collection to Enriqueta Rylands, who was building the University of Manchester Library. Many of Althorp's furnishings were sold off during the twentieth century, and between 1975 and 1992 alone approximately 20% of the contents were auctioned.

The house at Althorp was a ""classically beautiful"" red brick Tudor building, but its appearance was radically altered, starting in 1788, when the architect Henry Holland was commissioned to make extensive changes. Mathematical tiles were added to the exterior, encasing the brick, and four Corinthian pilasters were added to the front. The grand hall entrance to the house, Wootton Hall, was cited by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as ""the noblest Georgian room in the county"". The Great Dining Room in the east wing extension of the house was added in 1877 to designs by John Macvicar Anderson, its walls hung with faded, red damask silk. Numerous fireplaces and furnishings were brought to Althorp from Spencer House in London during the Blitz for safekeeping and still remain. The Picture Gallery stretches for 115 feet (35 m) on the first floor of the west wing, and is one of the best remaining examples of the original Tudor oak woodwork and ambiance in the mansion. It has an extensive collection of portraits, including Anthony van Dyck's War and Peace, a John de Critz portrait of James I, a Mary Beale portrait of Charles II, and many others. Some £2 million was spent on redecorating the palace in the 1980s, during which time most of the religious paintings of Althorp were sold off.

In total, the grounds of Althorp estate contain 28 listed buildings and structures, including nine planting stones. The former falconry, now a Grade I listed building, was built in 1613. Gardener's House is listed as a Grade II* listed building in its own right, as are the Grade II listed West and East Lodges. The mustard-yellow Grade II listed Stable Block, designed by architect Roger Morris with a Palladian influence, was ordered by Charles, Fifth Earl of Sutherland in the early 1730s. The French landscape architect André Le Nôtre was commissioned to lay out the park and grounds in the 1660s, and further alterations were made during the late 18th century under Henry Holland. Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, she was interred on a small island in the middle of the ornamental Round Oval lake. A Doric-style temple with Diana's name inscribed on top, situated across from the lake, is a tourist attraction during July and August when the house and estate are open to the public, although the exhibition centre, situated in the old stable block, closed permanently in 2013.

Beautiful map of Sumatra and the southern part of Malaysia, with Singapore shown as Cinglolo. Large cartouche of a man riding an elephant. Both Sumatra and Sri Lanka have been associated with the mythical island of Taprobana. This map originates from 'Cosmographia' published posthumously by Münster's stepson Hienrich Petri.

The German text block appears to be an excerpt from an old document or book. Here is the English translation:

""We learn from Varthema that in Taprobana, which is now Sumatra, there are better and also stronger than average elephants. It is also said that the pepper of this island is better than elsewhere, which the inhabitants of Malabar take in large quantities, because it is lighter than other pepper, so that one can trade it for their weight in gold.

Pliny writes that in ancient times people believed that this island was another world. On the side of Alexander the Great, one learned that it was an island and not a continent; his deeds have taught us that it is one of the islands that is rich in gold and precious stones in India. He also writes that an embassy was sent to the emperor of the whole country of India by Claudius Caesar, which told of the peculiarities, goods and customs of the country, and among other things, that there are trees that bear wool, as has been seen for several hundred years among people, worse than they.""
About the maker:

Sebastian Munster is generally regarded as one of the important map makers of the 16th Century. Munster was a linguist and mathematician, who initially taught Hebrew in Heidelberg. He issued his first mapping of Germany in 1529, after which he issued a call for geographical information about Germany to scholars throughout the country.

The Ronson lighter company

The company started as The Art Metal Works in 1897 and was incorporated on July 20, 1898, by Max Hecht, Louis Vincent Aronson and Leopold Herzig, in Newark, New Jersey. Louis V. Aronson was a huge creative driving force for the company; and, with a few business adjustments, including the addition of Alexander Harris (1910–11) as Business Manager, the company soon became World Famous. In the 1910s The Art Metal Works were producing very good quality Hood Ornaments and gained a reputation as a dependable supplier of same. All accounts state that Louis Aronson was a gifted man, who at 16 years old set up a money-making shop in his parent's home - before receiving a U.S. patent for a commercially valuable metal-plating process he developed when he was 24 years old, and he sold half the rights while retaining the Right to Use. ""His experiments, which he has been conducting since his early youth, resulted in 1893 in the discovery of a process for electrically producing tinplate. Much money was expended upon improving the process... and has been of great practical value to the whole industry. Retaining its rights, he sold half the patent rights, and later used part of the proceeds to open the Art Metal Works in Newark, N.J. Soon the company was producing a variety of high-quality Lamps, Book ends, Art Statues and other decorative items, prized today for their detail in the collector marketplace.

On the 30th of September 1860 the registry at Se`vres lists two pair of 'Vases Paris de milleu garnis, pa^te tender fond bleu de´cor en or / Sujet de figures et d’animaux paysages par Van Marcke / ornament garniture Blanchard.' The sole distinction between the two entries is that one is ‘bleu’ and the other is ‘turquoise’. Both were exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1867 (nos. 164-165 and no. 160, respectively). The ‘bleu’ pair were offered to the Queen of Holland on January 1868 (Vbb. 12, folio 50); the ‘turquoise’ were sold to M. Grace on 27 November 1867. The registry also retains a black and white photographic record of one of the pairs, which corresponds directly to the decoration on the present example, the registry card dated 1860.

E´mile Van Marcke de Lummen (French, 1827-1891) is recorded as a painter on porcelain at the Manufacture de Se`vres from 1853-1870. He was also a noted Barbizon painter who studied with Constant Troyon. He exhibited at the Paris salons from 1857 on, receiving medal in 1867, 1869, 1870 and was invested with the Legion of Honor in 1872. His work is in the collections of numerous museums in France as well as The Metropolitan Museum in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 

Van Marcke was born in Se`vres, Hauts-de-Seine, to a family of porcelain painters: his Belgian grandfather, Charles Van Marcke (1773-1830) and father, Jean-Baptiste Jules Van Marcke (1797-1848), painted at Se`vres from 1825 to 1832. It was there that Jean-Baptiste met his wife and E´mile’s mother, Julie Palmyra Robert, herself an artist and daughter of the director of the painting workshops at the Se`vres factory.",0

Attached you can see a screenshot of some lots due for sale on the 26th November at Christie's, I for one will be very excited to see the end results 

For those die-hard Russian silver collectors out there this piece is just about as rare and important as they come, it confused me, to begin with, because its clearly made by Pavel Ovchinnikov, his other works of this kind are know and easily found with a little internet research, however it is stamped for Ivan Khlebnikov

The import extract is as follows ""The growing fame helped the factory to receive the honorary orders. Together with the firm ""Nicols and Plinke"", as well as with jewellers Pavel Akimovich Ovchinnikov (1830–1888) and Ivan Ekimovich Morozov (1825-1885) he was involved in the renovation of the Palace silver dinner sets. "" 

The two silversmiths were working at the same time, in the same pallet of materials and on the same projects, this link inexplicably solves the mystery of how two of the three greatest silversmiths in Russia (Faberge being the third of course) came to collaboration 

The casket itself is an exceptionally rare find, I’ve only ever seen one other of this type come up for auction, it was just over 10 years ago in Christie's, it was half the size, you can see on 1stdibs for the current market value of Ovchinnikov pieces, they are around the £15-£20,000 for small objects and £20-£40,000 for medium to large objects like this 

The piece is solid silver with gold gilding and cloisonné polychrome enamel, it’s detailed with scrolls and stylised flowers on stippled grounds within geometric borders, the two handles formed as cockerels and its finished with clawed ball feet

The box is fully and clearly hallmarked A.O 1891, 84 with a rearing horse, then Khlebnikov in Russian Cyrillic below the Imperial warrant which as mentioned was awarded to Khlebnikov by the then Czar Nicholas II (18 May 1868 - 17th July 1918) and his wike the Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna (6 June 1872-17th July 1918)

Condition wise the piece to my eyes and hands looks amazing, the finish around one of the claw feet at the top looks slightly different to the others so it may have possibly been repaired at some point, otherwise its museum quality","and weight to follow

Please note all measurements are taken at the widest point.

Khlebnikov factory The history

The founder of the dynasty, Ivan Petrovich Khlebnikov was born in 1819 in Moscow, in the burgher family in Luzhniki region. Practically nothing was known about his works until he established a private firm. It might be possible that the son followed up the father’s business. Piotr Khlebnikov had been enlisted in merchantry since 1832 and was the owner of the trading and manufacturing jewellery establishment. Very little is known about the history of the firm.

According to some researchers, Ivan Petrovich was working in St. Petersburg until 1867. He founded the manufacturing firm in Moscow in 1870. He wrote, ""being engaged in the silver and gold articles trading for about forty years, I opened a manufactory of my own...» It is possible that in the 1830s, I. Khlebnikov already owned a shop, but he opened the factory later, at the turn of 60-70s of the 19th century. One hundred people were working at the factory and the turnover of production was 56 thousand rubles in 1871. Since that time, the firm began to grow. Several shops were opened: a store at the Kuznetski Bridge in the house of Solodovnikov, a store on Ilijnskaya street in the house of Novgorod courtyard in the silver row. New shops were opened in other cities: in Saint Petersburg in Nevsky Prospekt and in the main line of the Nizhny Novgorod fair.

The factory was well equipped with the latest technique for all types of works, produced articles in all major styles of the second half of the 19th - early 20th century. The Russian and Modern styles were very popular, as well as various historic styles: the Neo-Baroque, Neo-Rococo, and Neo-classicism styles.

In addition to the main factory with special space for painting and sculpture, about 300 workers were employed; there were special workshops for stone cutting, metal processing, etc. Khlebnikov matured as a jeweller in the period of his close collaboration with the Petersburg firm Gasse.

He regularly participated in various exhibitions. For the first time, Ivan Petrovich exhibited his works together with P. A. Ovchinnikov at the Moscow Polytechnic exhibition in 1872. His works were awarded with two large gold medals.

The growing fame helped the factory to receive the honorary orders. Together with the firm ""Nicols and Plinke"", as well as with jewellers Pavel Akimovich Ovchinnikov (1830–1888) and Ivan Ekimovich Morozov (1825-1885) he was involved in the renovation of the Palace silver dinner sets. 

Khlebnikov factory produced for Anichkov and Gatchina palaces 160 new items of The Golden Set made by artists G. F. Eckart and J. G. Blom in 1759-1784; The missing items were made for other sets of these same palaces; The Dessert set with the monogram of Catherine II, donated by Prince G. Potemkin was renovated; The Orlovsky dinner set was manufactured in 1772-1776; The Fourth Camping set was made. It was submitted to the Imperial Palace in 1797 as a gift from merchant Glazunov; Coffee pots, teapots, sugar bowls, milk jugs, teaspoons and spoons for salt, quadrangular flat serving dishes for several dinner sets from the Winter Palace on the old models were manufactured according to the old models.

From the first years of its existence, the factory gained the right to be ranked as the Supplier of the Imperial family due to high quality of the produced silver and gold articles. Khlebnikov supplied with his production Grand Dukes since 1869. He was titled the supplier of the court of the Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich in 1869, continually had been receiving orders for the wardrobe of Her Majesty the Empress Maria Alexandrovna since 1873. This fact was an honorary distinction and evidenced about his good reputation among the customers. Khlebnikov’s jewellery came to fashion. Having achieved recognition, Ivan dreamed of the most honourable title ""The Supplier of the Imperial Court"". He wrote in 1875, ""the right to be called the Supplier of the court... will serve me and my heirs, the successors of my business – the most invaluable encouragement to continue honest labor and precious estimation of my firm"". Finally, in 1879 he received the long-awaited title of 'The Supplier of Russian Imperial Court"" and the right to depict the national armorial bearings on the factory sign.

The firm of Khlebnikov was awarded with the title of ""The Supplier of the Danish, Dutch and Serbian Kings’ Courts"", as well as ""THe SUpplier of Montenegrian Prince Court"". Ivan Petrovich died in 1881, at the age of 62, was buried in the Spaso-Andronikov monastery. His sons inherited his business: Michael, Alex, Nicholas and Vladimir. 300 artisans were working at their factory ""Partnership I. P. Khlebnikov, Sons & Co” in 1882. There were the goldsmiths, coppersmiths, chasers, haberdashers, enamellers and filigree artists. They represented all sectors of goldsmith. There were specialized workshops, the number of workers in which amounted 1,000 people. The fame of the factory and its authority after the death of Ivan Petrovich did not diminished. Together with the best Moscow jewellers-manufacturers, the firm participated in the decoration of the temple of Christ the Savior. The Khlebnikov’s family created nearly 50 religious articles according to their sketches and drawings: ostensories, chalices, Holy-water bowls, and jugs for Holy water, incense burners, serving dishes, and icon-lamps.

Nevertheless, the mass-market production mainly provided the financial wellbeing of the company. Large quantity of medium-priced silver objects, dinnerware, cutlery and jewellery was produced. A trading-industrial enterprise under the name Partnership for production of silver, gold and jewellery “I. P. Khlebnikov, Sons and Co” was established on the basis of the company. It expanded and assimilated well-known jewellery shops and factories owned by Sazikov, both in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The catalog of M. M. Postnikov “Gold and Silver Manufacturing of the 15th-20th centuries"" narrated that by 1897 the factory of brothers Khlebnikov possessed two steam engines and one steam boiler. They manufactured production for the total amount of 172 372 rubles.

The achievements of the firm ""I. P. Khlebnikov, Sons & Co"" were distinguished in the development of Russian jewellery”. Ivan Petrovich was awarded with a bronze medal on the Anninskaya ribbon and five Golden medals. His elder son, Mikhail Ivanovich was awarded with the order of Stanislaus of the third degree in 1881 and was ranked as an honorary citizen of St. Petersburg in 1883. Other brothers were ranked as honorable citizens in 1887.

The factory was closed on June 24, 1917. Under the will of one of the Khlebnikov’s brothers, the shares of the company were donated to Moscow County Zemstvo. The main enterprise was reorganized in the Moscow platinum factory in 1918. It mainly produced all kinds of items for the electrochemical industry and research laboratories, and in addition, a small amount of silver jewellery, mainly utensils, cutlery and glass holders, which were marked with the seal ""platinum-device"".

The memory remained from the firm P. Khlebnikov, Sons and Co”, jewellery treasures and the facade of the factory building (it was built on the crossing of Ryumin lane and Upper Radischevskaya street)."

Jews of saint Petersburg:
The history of the Jews in Saint Petersburg (formerly known as Petrograd and then Leningrad) dates back to the 18th century and there is still a Jewish community in the city Today. In the late 18th century, the annexation of eastern Poland meant millions more Jews were now subjects of the Russian Empire, many of whom flocked to the city. When Catherine the Great created the Pale of Settlement to attempt to contain the new Jewish Population, Jewish settlement was largely restricted. Under Tsar Alexander II upper class Jews fitting certain criteria were allowed to live in the city, and many other Jews who did Not fit these categories settled illegally. By the end of his reign in 1881, the Jewish Population of the city was 17,253. Unlike other cities in the Russian Empire, Saint Petersburg never had a pogrom, likely due to the amount of police and army presence it Had as the capital. The community continued to grow, despite expulsions and Persecution, and flourished creatively until the Bolshevik Revolution.
The Grand Choral Synagogue of Saint Petersburg is the third-largest synagogue in Europe.

Ogden College

Bowling Green, Kentucky

1877-1928

The school opened in September 1877 and was chartered in March 1878.  It was named for Robert W. Ogden, who “bequeathed his estate to provide a free education to young men of Warren County, Kentucky.”   According to the 1917 Cardinal, the school yearbook, the amount of the gift was $50,000.   The school had only three requirements of students: that they be “regular in attendance, gentlemanly in deportment and diligent in study.”

Originally, Ogden had both collegiate and preparatory courses.  In 1900 the collegiate course of study was dropped. However, collegiate-level courses were added back in 1904 and by 1912 Ogden had returned to its original structure.  The 1917 Cardinal shows 25 men working at the collegiate level, with another 107 enrolled in three classes of preparatory school.  Another 20 students were enrolled in a commercial program called penmanship. 

College literature extolled the value of the small school, with its close-knit and caring faculty.  The Ogden faculty totaled six.  As graduates of top universities, these were expected to teach whatever academic subjects were needed.  For example, the Professor of Ancient Languages also taught geometry and modern Spanish.

In addition to athletics, the men and boys participated in literary societies, a drama club, a glee club and an orchestra.

At its peak in 1918, 162 students were enrolled..  However financial problems led to a loss of accreditation in 1925.  On November 19,1927 Ogden College signed a merger agreement with Western Kentucky Normal College.  

The original building was Ogden Hall, formerly the Thomas C. Calvert House. 

The 1917 Cardinal describes the seven-acre campus as “one of the most picturesque spots to be found in the county.”  Out of the “stately trees” and “rare shrubbery” Ogden Hall stands on a hill, “above the noise and bustle of the city.” 

By 1960 Ogden Hall was nearly a century old and was described as being held together only by the ivy growing on it.  It was razed in 1967 to make way for a new Ogden Hall.

In 1924 a bequest by Perry Snell allowed Ogden College to add a second building, named Snell Hall.  It was on the register of historic places, but attempts to fund a renovation, led to its razing in 2005. A new Snell Hall was later built at Western Kentucky. 

Ogden College looked back to a time in the 19th Century when its football team defeated Vanderbilt and lost to Yale by a touchdown.  By 1917 Ogden had come from seasons when there were no football games at all or when their schedule tended more to high school teams.  The 1916 team was successful by those standards, going 4-1.  The yearbook comments on the enthusiasm which brought 35 players—one in four of the student body—to the practice field.   With only 25 college students, the team would surely have been heavy with prep players. 

In the 1920’s before Ogden closed, the team played a much stronger collegiate schedule, including Murray State, Tennessee Tech, Kentucky Wesleyan, Louisville and Transylvania.

INTERESTING ITEM IN THE SCRAP BOOK: Included in the Scrap Book, is a Sales Postcard dated July 18th, 1899, addressed to “Manager Football Team”, Ogden College, Bowling Green, KY” from Horace Partridge & Co., of Boston, MASS, selling Football Outfits. 

WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COLLECTION, WILL BE HUGELY DESIRABLE TO, ALL, WKU ALUMNI and HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE PURCHASED AND GIFTED BY THAT ALUM, TO THE LIBRARY OF WKU, FOR PRESERVANCE OF THEIR HISTORICAL RECORDS!
THEY REALLY NEED TO BE TREATED AS ‘MUSEUM’ PIECES(S)!

New York: American Heritage Publishing Co. Ancient Rome: in an age when Latin has become rare and history before the Clinton era is befogged, this book serves a real purpose. It details the history of Rome (city and empire) from the Etruscan period through the republic, empire and founding of Constantinople to the fall under Romulus Augustulus. Lost Worlds: for over 5000 years men have left the record of their lives in what is known as history. Yet there have been many puzzling gaps. A number of major civilizations of the past with fully developed and creative societies, seemingly indestructible, somehow disintegrated or disappeared. Vague memories of some lingered through the centuries in myth and epic poetry, in tantalizing passages of the Old Testament. Others left enigmatic monuments- a temple wall, a pyramid- to hint forgotten glory. Still others were swallowed by the desert sands or the jungle forests. Nine of these civilizations are recreated. The recovery of these long-forgotten episodes in human history has been an astonishing adventure, which the author recounts with abundant scholarship and literary skill. Elizabethan World: no period has surpassed this period in adventure, intrigue and flamboyant heroism. Middle Ages: loaded with black & white and color photographs, sketches and artwork. Through a chronology of the era the knights of the First Crusade, the Life of the Nobles, work life, faith, ideologies and the artwork that the people of the time have left behind as their legacy. Ancient Greece: the achievements of the ancient Greeks form the foundation of modern Western civilization. This book traces the course of Greek history from the Minoan and Mycenaean kingdoms to the rival city-states of Athens and Sparta to Alexander the Great's empire and the rise of Rome. The vivid account celebrates the extraordinary legacy of Greek civilization: the epics of Homer; the seminal tragedies of Agamemnon, Euripides and Sophocles; the transforming philosophy of Plato and Aristotle; the architectural wonders of the Acropolis; and the birth of democracy. Here is an intelligent and remarkably handsome survey of ancient Greece, designed for anyone who would welcome the chance to learn more about the 1,500-year journey of this extraordinary civilization.

Many prominent artist of the day contributed to the work, including W. Hooker, Mrs. Withers, J. Robertson, B. Cotton, E. Smith and more.

For the first time in England, steel plates were used for the engravings, along with a variety of techniques including mezzotint and hand coloring. The prints are also enhanced with gum arabic so the fruits almost glisten.",0

The stunning patina adorning each bust accentuates the intricate facial expressions, breathing life into the features of these esteemed scholars and philosophers. Resting upon gracefully curved bronze pedestals that are then placed upon the gorgeous black cylindrical marble pedestals, with their fine grey even mottling, they exude an aura of timeless grandeur and refinement.  The meticulous attention to detail is evident in every aspect, from the lifelike depiction of hair, wrinkles, and frown lines to the expressive eyes that seem to hold a universe of knowledge within their depths.

Among this distinguished collection, you will find the likeness of Gottfried Wilhelm (von) Leibniz, the German polymath and philosopher whose contributions to mathematics and philosophy have left an indelible mark on history. Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher and scientist, renowned as one of the greatest intellectual figures of Western civilization, is also honored in this ensemble. The wit and critical thinking of Voltaire, one of the leading writers of the Enlightenment era, shine through in his representation. And finally, the visionary Pythagoras of Samos, whose mathematical and philosophical insights continue to shape our understanding of the world, completes this esteemed quartet.

Kändler and J.F. Eberlein. These figures are the best quality that Meissen offers, very well hand painted and in excellent condition. Each sense is represented by scarcely clothed nymphs with attendant putti. Each one bears a different colored drape, including deep blue, pink, light blue, rich puce, and white. Their clothes are further adorned with 24-karat gilt patterns and flowers. Each figure is emblematic of their sense with an appropriate ascribed attribute: Hearing playing the guitar while a stag sits at her feet with a putti singing and a 24-karat gilt Horn at the puttis feet, Smell holding beautiful flowers with a bouquet of pot-pourri and a putti arranging flowers with a dog smelling the essence of an insect, Touch is seen with a parrot and a dog biting her shoulder and toe while two putti are playing, Taste and a monkey sharing delicious fruit from a bowl while a putti is cooking food and a ham is left for later consumption, Sight using a telescope while holding a mirror with her putti counterpart, while an eagle is perched at her feet. Each figure is depicted on scroll-molded bases further decorated in gilding. Found on each base is the body part associated with that sense. With crossed swords marks in underglaze-blue, incised model numbers 1035, 1136, 1042, 1051 and 1062, various impressed numerals and painters' numbers.

The crystal prisms are exceptionally large and each one is hand-beveled.  The middle section is fantastic, with interchanging gilt bronze and crystal elements.  The crystal midsections are each cut and beveled with angular sections.  The top is gorgeous with a large crystal hand-diamond cut finial.  Each gilt bronze arm extends outwards with a large triangular or exceptionally cut and beveled prism attached to the end with a cut-crystal star which terminates at the end of each.  Each girandole is mounted on a triangular marble base with ormolu beads and an ormolu mounted base.  The base also consists of faceted and hand-etched and hand-engraved mirrors on crest-shaped decorations. The girandoles sit on four exceptionally large hand-painted faux marble pedestals.  The elongated middle of the pedestals are painted to look like siena marble white the base and tops are hand-painted to look like antico verde marble.

Each hollow figure portraying one of the immortals in an animated pose, with highly detailed facial features, four pierced with apertures for the insertion of facial hair, clad in finely chased robes, all but two with their characteristic attributes, their bases bearing either two seal marks reading Yangqinghe Jiuji gongyibu and Zhe'ning Hu Qiusheng zao, or three marks in regular script reading Yangqinghe Jiuji gongyibu, Shang and Sheng zuo, original hand-carved wood stands. Measures: 11 1/4in (28.5cm) high (tallest one).
The earliest records of the silver atelier known as Yangqinghe date to 1775 in Shanghai. By the end of the Qing dynasty, it had the reputation as being the best silver workshop on the Shanghai Bund. Not only did they make decorative items, but also accessories and jewelry, popular among the Shanghai elite. After 1850, the atelier divided into three separate branches, Jiuji, Faji and Fuji, and passed to the ownership of Shao Youlian's family. 

Shao was a statesman who had served as the Qing court's charge d'affaires at St. Petersburg, had been a past governor of Taiwan and acting governor of Hunan. After his death in 1901, his family did not immediately divide up his estate, but his second son Shao Heng, gradually assumed ownership of the Jiuji branch of Yangqinghe. Shao Heng was known as a spendthrift and tended to neglect the business. Jiuji eventually ceased operation in 1935.

The bases of the some of the figures in the present lot are marked with the seal of the atelier's decorative art division, gongyibu, and also bear the mark of the individual maker, Hu Qiusheng.

Figures of the eight immortal are popular decorative motifs because it is believed that they can bestow blessings. They represent the spectrum of the human condition - young and old, rich and poor, civil and military, learned and uncultivated, male and female.

This is one of the rarer signed LaVerne pieces, due to its size, unusual design, and beautiful vibrant colorway. LaVerne is known to make spectacular pieces out of mixed-metals, and through a specialized acid-etched technique that the father-son duo developed, they are able to make extraordinary pieces which are incomparable to any other mixed-metal artist's work. This particular piece is of a silver/grey ground which has been etched and acid washed creating an elaborate design of swirling black and speckled silver speckled decorations. Over the silver ground are green and yellow iridescent etched and acid-washed horses, both adults and child horses, frolicking's around what would be considered a silver meadow.

Charles Alexander Anderson.

Lieutenant General Sir Charles Alexander Anderson, KCB, KCIE, AM (10 February 1857 – 20 February 1940) was Commander of British Troops in South China.

Military career Anderson was commissioned into the Royal Horse Artillery in 1876. He took part in the Jowaki-Afridi expedition 1877, the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1878 and the Burma expedition in 1885. He went to the North West Frontier in India in 1897. He was awarded the Albert Medal for an event at Ferozepore on 30 August 1906 when a fire broke out in one of the Magazines of the Ferozepore Arsenal. The citation reads: Major-General Anderson, who directed the subsequent operations from the roof at the edge of the Magazine Compound, at a distance of some 20 yards, having ordered all persons to be cleared out of the fort, and placed a cordon round it at 1,000 yards distance, a steam fire engine was got to work, and the fire party which had been organised commenced their highly dangerous task of clearing cell No. 8 in which was stored some 19,000 lbs of gunpowder; they eventually succeeded in so doing, thereby cutting off the fire by the intervention of an empty cell. Had the powder in this cell exploded, the explosion must have been communicated to cells in an adjoining magazine, where 300,000 lbs of gunpowder were stored.

He was appointed Commander of 1st Brigade for the Bazaar Valley expedition in 1908, and went on to be Commander of the Mohmand Field Force later that year. He was appointed Commander of British Troops in South China in 1910. He served in the First World War as General Officer Commanding the Southern Army in India from 1917. He retired in 1920. In 1921, he was conferred the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the emperor of Japan.",":

Over the past century, Smith & Watson has produced premium and traditional pieces that have dazzled the world of fine furniture. Known to most as a “London Furniture Shop in New York”, a collection of over 1000 designs are custom made to order by the most skilled craftspeople available.

For more than 100 years, Smith & Watson has been celebrated as one of the only firms that has endlessly catered “to the trade” with unparalleled quality and supreme attention to detail. Taking inspiration from the genius of Chippendale, Sheraton, Hepplewhite, and others associated with the ""golden age of furniture,"" they have carried the excellence of the eighteenth century successfully into the twenty-first.

Smith & Watson was founded in 1907 by Richard Smith and Alexander Watson and was quaintly referred to as ""a London furniture shop in New York."" In the early 1940s the company was purchased by the late John Ryan whose sons, John P. and Robert, would later follow him into the business. By this time the firm had moved to larger quarters and was catering to the “carriage trade”, wealthy New York families such as the Rockefellers, the Astors, the Carnegies, and the Mellons. By the late fifties Smith & Watson had been “discovered” by the interior design and architectural trade. Later also catering to the corporate business, political, and artistic elite.",":

Old bird print depicting an adult and young Temminck's Auk. This print originates from 'The new and heretofore unfigured species of the birds of North America', published 1866-1869.

This spectacular large folio lithograph is from Daniel Giraud Elliot's The New and Heretofore Unfigured Species of the Birds of North America. The work was published in New York for the author between 1866 and 1869. Each lithograph features original hand-coloring. The plates were predmoninantly executed by Bowen of Philadelphia after originals by Elliot and celebrated natural history artist, Joseph Wolf. It is believed only 200 copies of this work were ever printed. 

The work generally depicted life-size renderings of birds that were not previously illustrated by Alexander Wilson or John James Audubon. It had a particular focus on birds of the American West including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. It also depicts some birds from the Alaskand and Arctic regions. Many of birds were drawn from birds brought back from government-led expeditions in the West as well as private sources including John Xantus de Vesey. 

Elliot’s lithographs are some of the most valuable American bird plates. Elliot was a prominent American zoologist. He was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the American Ornithologists’ Union. Elliot was also curator of zoology at Chicago’s Field Museum. 

In the preface, Elliot describes his intentions for the work: ""Since the time of Wilson and Audubon, no work has been published upon American Ornithology, containing life-size representations of the various species that have been discovered since the labors of those great men were finished. The valuable productions of Cassin, as well as the revised edition of the ninth volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, the joint labor of Messrs. Baird, Cassin and Lawrence had indeed appeared . but no attempt had been made to continue the works of the first great American naturalists in a similar manner . It was, therefore, with the desire to contribute . towards the elucidation of the comparatively little known species of the Birds of North America, their habits and economy, as well as to render their forms familiar so far as life-size representation of them might serve to do, that I undertook the present publication.""

Puffins are any of three species of small alcids (auks) in the bird genus Fratercula. These are pelagic seabirds that feed primarily by diving in the water. They breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs or offshore islands, nesting in crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil. Two species, the tufted puffin and horned puffin, are found in the North Pacific Ocean, while the Atlantic puffin is found in the North Atlantic Ocean.

All puffin species have predominantly black or black and white plumage, a stocky build, and large beaks that get brightly colored during the breeding season. They shed the colorful outer parts of their bills after the breeding season, leaving a smaller and duller beak. Their short wings are adapted for swimming with a flying technique underwater. In the air, they beat their wings rapidly (up to 400 times per minute) in swift flight, often flying low over the ocean's surface. (Source: Wikipedia)

Paper manufacturer's label to underside ‘Bruno Mari 1965 Tetracono S.M. cinquanta esemplari numerati e firmati esemplare n. 28 Munari Edizioni Danese Milano’. This work is number 18 from the edition of 50. This kinetic sculpture is comprised of four rotating cones which alternate between green and red.
A painter, a sculptor, a graphic and product designer, an artist in the broadest sense, Bruno Munari has been one of the most independent and influent figures in the history of Italian and international designIn postwar years, after abandoning the late futurist groups, Munari moved towards artistic experimentations that were more and more connected to the realm of matter and machine: he gradually embark on an exploration of kinetic art, of the coexistence of organic and mechanic motion characterizing the work of Alexander Calder and several members of the Zero group. The discourse on form as something to explore was expressed in Munari’s powerful graphics — always oriented towards a direct and effective communication despite an apparently abstract use of color and geometry. the object was originally intended by danese milano as an artist's 
multiple, to circulate at a price closer to a consumer product. it was 
intended to be industrially manufactured. turns out neither of these ws 
true in the end. the first version had motors to turn the cones and it was 
a resounding technical flop. this second version without motors was 
motivated by an exhibition in amsterdam at tghe stedlijk museum. 50 copies 
were made, but they were not really at an industrial scale. basically, 
some guy in one of munari's students' studios who knew how to operate a

Published by Stiftung Insel Hombroich, 1999. 1st Ed hardcover. The Museum Insel Hombroich (Museum Island Hombroich), Neuss, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, is both a park and a museum combining architecture, art and nature on over 62 acres of meadowland. The park includes the ""Kirkeby-Feld"" and the ""Raketenstation"" (""rocket station""), a disused NATO missile base. The museum located on the Museum Island is called ""Museum Insel Hombroich"". It presents both antique art from Asia and modern art. The Museum and the grounds around it are part of the ""Stiftung Insel Hombroich"", which was founded in 1996. The inception of the Museum Insel Hombroich occurred in 1982 when real estate agent and art collector Karl Heinrich Müller purchased Rosa Haus (""Pink House""), an overgrown industrialist's villa with garden, which was built in 1816. Müller's intention was to support local artists and architects. Landscape architect Bernhard Korte, who was commissioned to redesign the park, restored the old gardens and created minimalist landscapes. From 1982 to 1994 sculptor Erwin Heerich created eleven exhibition pavilions, which Müller called ""chapels in the landscape"". Heerich's elemental sculptures became the design base for these gallery pavilions. Erwin Heerich, Graubner Pavilion
The buildings include artworks from the collection of Karl Heinrich Müller, among them works by Hans Arp, Alexander Calder, Paul Cézanne, Eduardo Chillida, Lovis Corinth, Jean Fautrier, Alberto Giacometti, Yves Klein, Gustav Klimt, Henri Matisse, Francis Picabia, Rembrandt, Kurt Schwitters, and works from early China.

About:
Theodore Alexander and English aristocrat Lord Charles Spencer joined forces to produce a collection of furniture based on originals from Althorp, an English Stately Home (the childhood home of the late Princess Diana).
This collection was the idea of Charles Spencer, the ninth Earl of the estate “It has taken 19 generations of my family to build the collection and it would be a tragedy if all these wonderful things were lost.” The collection illustrates how family heirlooms can be integrated into modern spaces. Beautifully crafted in mahogany and walnut, the 18th and 19th century reproduction pieces have a decisive flair."

England, circa 1890

Thomas Webb & Sons was an English glass company, founded in 1837 by Thomas Webb (1804-1869) near Stourbridge, England. The company, known originally as the ""Crystal King of England,"" was noted for the high quality of its Cameo glass. Cameo glass is created by a process of etching and carving through a layer of opaque white glass, leaving a white relief design on a darker colored glass body. Some pieces used two layers of etched glass to create a three-color Cameo glass product.

The frieze features different scenes, meant to tell a unique story between the figures.  The engraving spans across the entirety of the vases’ surface. On the leftmost vase is a scene of men frolicking and dancing, riding on the back of a friendly lion, and happily drinking tea. The middle vase shows men engaged in scholarly conversation, reading books, and employing an elephant as a stationary chair. Finally, excitement returns in the rightmost vase, where men, dragons, and deities lark about across the land and sky.  The rich crimson tone of these vases is the predominant color of carved lacquer—also called cinnabar. To produce the color of the lacquer, artisans used a form of powdered mercury sulfide.

The writer of this work is William Alexander, and it was published by John Murray in 1814. This work aimed to illustrate and describe the traditional dress and customs of various Russian peoples, including indigenous groups, at the beginning of the 19th century. It serves as an important historical record of cultural attire and practices of that era. The detailed colored engravings were a common method of such documentation in a time before photography, intended to provide the Western audience with a visual account of distant cultures.

The three engravings depict members of the Ostiak community, an indigenous group in Russia, dressed in traditional attire as per the early 19th century.

1. The first engraving shows an Ostiak man from the Obe region. He is wearing a fur-trimmed parka-like garment with geometric patterns and a hood, possibly indicating winter wear. His face is framed by the hood, and he stands with his arms outstretched, suggesting a welcoming posture or possibly displaying his attire.

2. The second image captures an Ostiak man in his winter hunting dress. This outfit is practical and vivid, featuring a bright red coat with fur trim around the cuffs and hood, which is worn over blue trousers. He is equipped with snowshoes and holds what appears to be a paddle or tool, indicating readiness for hunting or traveling across snowy terrains.

3. The third engraving represents a Female Ostiak, clothed in a long, brown dress with a light blue shawl or scarf draped around her shoulders and head. Her garment is simple yet elegant, with a buttoned bodice, suggesting everyday wear. Her hands are clasped in front of her, and she gazes directly at the viewer with a composed expression.

Each illustration is meticulously colored, which was typical of the time as a means to convey the richness and diversity of cultural attire. The illustrations provide a detailed look at the clothing, suggesting materials like fur and wool which would be necessary for the harsh climates where the Ostiaks lived. Such engravings were crucial for anthropological and cultural studies, offering insights into the lives of people far removed from the Western societies of the time. William Alexander's work, through these illustrations, contributes valuable information to the historical record, capturing the essence of the Ostiak people's traditional way of life.

The Ostiaks, historically referred to in this manner, are indigenous people living in Western Siberia. They are more commonly known today as the Khanty and the Mansi. The Khanty people traditionally inhabit areas along the Ob River and its tributaries in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, while the Mansi are found around the western Siberian region, in the area known as the Ural Mountains. Their territories are part of what is now known as the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug – Yugra, which is an autonomous okrug of Russia.",0

The engravings presented show a deep dive into the cultural tapestry of early 19th century Russia through the lens of traditional attire and customs. 

The first engraving depicts a Barabinzian woman, likely from the Siberian steppe, characterized by her distinctive, layered clothing with a patterned dress and a strikingly colored headwrap which indicates the unique styles that were prevalent among the indigenous Barabinzian people. The second engraving portrays a Mestcherakian individual, where the clothing might reflect a combination of functional needs for a nomadic lifestyle as well as the aesthetic preferences unique to the Mestcherakian culture. The clothing is practical yet distinct, with bold colors that might signify social status or regional variations. 

The final engraving illustrates a Russian peasant, which provides insights into the everyday life and labor of the rural population. His attire is utilitarian and robust, suitable for the manual work and harsh conditions, exemplified by the sturdy footwear and the heavy coat. The tool he carries indicates his labor-intensive lifestyle.

All three engravings from William Alexander's ""Picturesque Representations of the Dress and Manners of the Russians"" are meticulously detailed, highlighting not only the clothing but also the postures and accessories that speak to the customs and daily activities of these groups. These images provide a significant contribution to the visual historiography of Russia's diverse cultures, embodying the complexities of their societal structures and the variances in their regional clothing. They serve as a valuable historical record, enabling contemporary audiences to glimpse the rich tapestry of life and society in Russia during this era.

Creating a description that emphasizes the elegance, historical significance, and meticulous artistry of the Podiceps californicus lithograph should appeal to collectors and individuals interested in ornithological art and historical illustrations from that period.

This spectacular large folio lithograph is from Daniel Giraud Elliot's The New and Heretofore Unfigured Species of the Birds of North America. The work was published in New York for the author between 1866 and 1869. Each lithograph features original hand-coloring. The plates were predmoninantly executed by Bowen of Philadelphia after originals by Elliot and celebrated natural history artist, Joseph Wolf. It is believed only 200 copies of this work were ever printed. 

The work generally depicted life-size renderings of birds that were not previously illustrated by Alexander Wilson or John James Audubon. It had a particular focus on birds of the American West including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the Rocky Mountains. It also depicts some birds from the Alaskand and Arctic regions. Many of birds were drawn from birds brought back from government-led expeditions in the West as well as private sources including John Xantus de Vesey. 

Elliot’s lithographs are some of the most valuable American bird plates. Elliot was a prominent American zoologist. He was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the American Ornithologists’ Union. Elliot was also curator of zoology at Chicago’s Field Museum. 

In the preface, Elliot describes his intentions for the work: ""Since the time of Wilson and Audubon, no work has been published upon American Ornithology, containing life-size representations of the various species that have been discovered since the labors of those great men were finished. The valuable productions of Cassin, as well as the revised edition of the ninth volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, the joint labor of Messrs. Baird, Cassin and Lawrence had indeed appeared . but no attempt had been made to continue the works of the first great American naturalists in a similar manner . It was, therefore, with the desire to contribute . towards the elucidation of the comparatively little known species of the Birds of North America, their habits and economy, as well as to render their forms familiar so far as life-size representation of them might serve to do, that I undertook the present publication.""

Burchardt Precht (d.1738), together with his sons Christian (d.1779) and Gustav (d.1773) were responsible for producing fine quality gilt-lead and gilt wood mirrors in Sweden during the 18th century. Although relatively little is known about Gustav, it has be noted that his father Burchardt, a sculptor and cabinet-maker originally from Bremen came to Stockholm in 1674 to work at Drottingham Palace. His son Christian was apprenticed to a goldsmith in 1721 before traveling extensively throughout Europe and returning to Stockholm in 1731. Later he became one of Sweden's leading Rococo silversmiths.

The design of this mirror, originally executed in gilt-lead, has been attributed to both Burchardt and Gustav, one example of which has beveled blue glass borders and crest. An identical example, attributed to Gustav, is illustrated in G. Child, world mirrors 1650-1900, London, 1990, p.297, pl. 768.

The expertly crafted curled beards lend an air of regality to the countenances, further enhancing the visual appeal of these sculptures. Notably, the choice of white marble for the faces creates a striking contrast against the colored marble used for the fabric, enhancing the lifelike quality of the pieces.

A defining characteristic of these busts is the meticulous attention to detail bestowed upon the sculpted fabric garments. The marble artistry impressively captures the weight and texture of real fabric, resulting in convincingly cascading folds that lend an organic quality to the sculptures. Each carved fold showcases the sculptor's skillful ability to imbue stone with the softness and fluidity reminiscent of actual drapery.

The turbans adorning these busts represent a pinnacle of the sculptor's mastery. Carved with remarkable precision, the turbans appear authentically wrapped and exude an undeniable sense of realism. Notably, the sculptor's attention to detail extends to the subtle depiction of knots at the back of the turbans, further accentuating the lifelike quality of the sculptures.

A rare and enchanting Meissen porcelain figure titled ""Till Eulenspiegel,"" crafted by the skilled hands of Willi Münch-Khe in 1928. This exquisite figurine portrays the legendary character Till Eulenspiegel in a moment of joviality, seated on a pristine white porcelain tree stump adorned with delicate hand-painted green details.

Till Eulenspiegel, the beloved German folk figure, is resplendent in a harlequin/jester attire that captivates with its vibrant colors. Diamonds in shades of white, lavender, and mint green adorn his costume, complemented by well-worn lavender boots and a magenta three-sleeve hat-cape secured with a delicate blue bow at the neck. Bells dangle from the ends of the sleeves, with the central sleeve at the back cascading down to the waist, creating a visual symphony of whimsy.

Perched on the stump, one foot raised, the other firmly grounded, Till Eulenspiegel exudes mirth with a devilish infectious grin and rosy cheeks. In his hand, he holds a naturalistic rattle of seed-pods on a branch, and he wears a delightful cross-over bag fashioned to resemble an owl that echoes the presence of a charming highly detailed hand-painted owl companion by his side.

The porcelain figurine stands 30 cm tall and bears the distinguished underglaze blue cross sword mark, along with incised and impressed numbers. The meticulous attention to detail captures the essence of Till Eulenspiegel's legacy, as he sits alongside his pet owl, embodying the spirit of German folklore. The scene is a nod to the carving found on Till Eulenspiegel's tombstone in Mölln, Germany, offering viewers a glimpse into the rich tapestry of medieval times and the enduring tales that have woven around this mischievous trickster.

The writer of this work is William Alexander, and it was published by John Murray in 1814. This work aimed to illustrate and describe the traditional dress and customs of various Russian peoples, including indigenous groups, at the beginning of the 19th century. It serves as an important historical record of cultural attire and practices of that era. The detailed colored engravings were a common method of such documentation in a time before photography, intended to provide the Western audience with a visual account of distant cultures.

The engravings present traditional clothing from the Koriak culture, which is an indigenous group in Russia:

1. **Female Koriak:** This engraving would typically show a Koriak woman dressed in traditional clothing that would be suitable for the everyday activities and climatic conditions of her environment. The attire likely includes a fur-lined hood or headpiece and a practical, warm dress or coat, possibly with indigenous patterns or ornaments.

2. **Koriak:** This image would represent a Koriak man in his standard attire. The clothing would be practical for the nomadic and hunting lifestyle of the Koriak people, usually made from animal skins and furs, and may include boots and gloves for warmth, with details that signify his identity and status within the community.

3. **Koriak in his dress of ceremony:** This would depict a Koriak man in ceremonial dress, which would be more elaborate and decorated than everyday wear. Such a garment would likely include symbolic decorations, perhaps denoting tribal affiliations, spiritual beliefs, or social status. Accessories might be used to signify the importance of the occasion, such as special headgear, jewelry, or weaponry.

The Koriak people live in the Koriak Autonomous Okrug, which is a part of Kamchatka Krai in the Russian Far East. They inhabit areas in the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula and the southern end of the Chukotka Peninsula. Their traditional territories include the tundra and the taiga regions of the Russian Far East, where they have historically engaged in reindeer herding, hunting, and fishing.",0

Each cushion is a one-of-a-kind and part of a sustainability project. It has been created from an up-cycled, recycled luxury fabric, used with the intentions of promoting a more eco-friendly environment by using already existing materials. We both celebrate and cherish the past and take care with rare and precious vintage and antique materials. Through layers of carefully added backing the delicate fabric has been fortified for longevity and thus preserved. (The original designer/brand has been fully credited below)

Description:
Large custom made pair of cushion created from an exquisite vintage silk Balenciaga fashion scarf in earthy autumnal shades. Softly textured earth brown ground with chalk like markings sketched horizontally with energy, marking a superb pattern. Balenciaga is a French fashion house founded by Spainish designer Cristóbal Balenciaga, referred to as ""the master of us all"" by Christian Dior, and who's current Creative Director is Alexander Wang. Jackie Kennedy famously upset John F. Kennedy for buying Balenciaga's expensive creations while he was President because he feared that the American public might think the purchases too lavish. Today the brand is most famous for the popular 'Lariat' bag. The two similar cushions in the same fabric are almost identical, one with and one without the original ‘Balenciaga’ signature name. This feature adds an elegant touch of prestige. The sophisticated duo are fabulous as a pair and would compliment even the most contemporary of interiors. Backed in new pure luxury Irish linen, filled with new duck and down feather insert and a concealed zip.

Showcasing an esoteric design and artful craftsmanship, this vintage overdyed rug has been given a twist. The controversial pistol pattern and atmospheric colorway woven into this piece work together creating a truly one-of-a-kind look. A faded backdrop sets the scene cultivating a thought-provoking focal point with a multifaceted impact open to the viewer's interpretation of the 2nd amendment. Regardless if hung on the wall in a gun club or placed on the floor in a shooting range, this gun rug has the ability to add immense visual interest to a space where there isn’t any. Whether or not this style speaks to you depends on your response to uninhibited, raw, and abstract forms of art.

Iconic in its styling and austere elegance, this overdyed rug is befitting for gun aficionados, NRA, and hunting enthusiasts in mind. Perfect for a gunroom, man cave, arms cache, trophy room, armory, gun club, great room, studio, study, loft, living room, drawing room, billiards room, clubhouse, large home office, or lounge area. The piece was made through a thorough process consisting of: distressing, overdyeing, and hand shaving the pistol pattern into the rug.

Paul Maitland Smith has been well-known and respected in the home furnishings industry since 1957, when he earned a solid reputation as a London-based antiques dealer and purveyor of reproduction furniture. He founded Maitland-Smith in 1979 after he had emigrated to Hong Kong and began manufacturing reproduction 18th century furniture and decorative accessories, sourcing product from Hong Kong, Thailand, China, and the Philippines.

Over time, he sold that company and founded Paul Maitland International, which manufactures occasional furniture and home accents. In 1996, his entrepreneurial spirit led to a new division, Theodore Alexander.","(approx)

A chromolithograph tennis print published 4th Jan, 1894, by Vincent Brooks, Day & Son Ltd. Lith., for Vanity Fair. The picture is titled 'Michael Michailovitch' and is an original print in very good condition of The Grand Duke Michael Michailovitch of Russia by Wag (A.G. Witherby, Witherby succeeded Thomas Gibson Bowles as editor of Vanity Fair). Michael is shown in his whites at the net ready to return the ball.

Vanity Fair was published in London from 1869 to 1914, and each magazine would contain a loose print of a caricature painted by various artists and would come with an amusing biography. 'Spy' worked for Vanity Fair for 40 years until it ceased publication in 1914 and is possibly the most well known of the VF artists.

Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia (1861 - 1929) was a grandson of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. As tradition demanded he followed a military career and served in the Russo-Turkish War in 1877 and became a Colonel and was adjutant at the Imperial court. In 1891 he married Countess Sophie von Merenberg. She was a woman of lesser status, and the marriage went ahead without permission, so Emperor Alexander III of Russia stripped him of his military titles and banished the couple from Russia. He settled permanently in England in 1900 in Staffordshire and later on the outskirts of London.",":

TRASFORMATIO
Design Non Convenzionale
TRASFORMATIO is a Design Line born from the collaboration between the artist Michele Iodice and the Esprit Nouveau Gallery in Naples.
Alberta Saladino, founder and soul of Esprit Nouveau Gallery, has been proactively involved in ‘900 antique pieces research during the last twenty years and invited Michele Iodice to think of a way to reinterpret some Art Deco complementary design and furnishing pieces, from her private collection.
TRASFORMATIO project has a Pioneer and artistic soul able to set the connection lines between past, present and future.
The whole IDEA was born with the aim to explore interactions between art and design.
TRASFORMATIO traces an historical path in human minds, that starts with the birth of design and reaches our living present, embracing artistic novelties with wisdom.
The common thread of the exhibition is dynamism.
“Most of the people think a furnishing piece can only be a set of elements that move in the emptiness of space. Nevertheless, for others it can be poetry”.
Alexander Calder described his most successful pieces of work with the above words.
Michele Iodice, fully interprets his thought through TRASFORMATIO. His art works are fluctuating in a dynamic equilibrium where they are able to break the physical limits of traditional static furniture, attributing them movement and lightness.
TRASFORMATIO artistic methods can be applied to every kind of support.
It does not reproduce, but it tears the item out of its traditional context to Revive it, instead, in a completely different and new environment.
The setup personally curated by the Neapolitan artist, combines a collection of pieces that express the close relationship between design and contemporary art, as well as the strong connection between cultural stratification and innovation.
Every object signed by Michele Iodice is rigorously realized by local artisans and tells about the attention to detail behind it, in a process that enhances the principles and values of “artigianato cosciente”, in English, “conscious craftsmanship”.
The materials used spans from wood, parchment, and Plexiglas, to steel, combined in a fusion that is aimed to reflect the complexity of the research that Iodice has been performing since years.",0

Vinton was a cadet at the academy and a close friend of artist James McNeill Whistler, who was also a cadet and peer at that time. Watercolor on paper, mounted under glass and housed in a molded wooden frame with gilt accent. 
Provenance: 
General Alexander Stewart Webb.
Descended to Webb's granddaughter, Anna Remsen Alexandre (1895-1984).
Sold from her estate, ""The Strawberry House"" / Calvin Burnham House, Lenox, Massachusetts, Douglass Auctions, South Deerfield, Massachusetts, April 25, 1985, Lot #91, for $300.
Elliot Sherman, Everett, Massachusetts.
Ed Jerome, Old Bridge, New Jersey (who replaced the water-stained mat).
Richard Blodgett ll, 1987.
Notes:
Drawing skills were critical training at West Point as soldiers would need to draw maps and sketch battlefield scenarios. Drafting was taught by Hudson River School painter Robert Walter Weir (1803-1889) and many of the cadets were prolific sketch artists, often as a comedic outlet.
It was previously believed the vignettes were painted by classmate James Abbot Whistler, who entered the Academy in 1851. The images are similar to known drawings by Whistler done during his years at West Point, before he flunked out at the end of June 1854, about five months before this is believed to have been drawn. (Whistler's appeal to be reinstated was submitted to Jefferson Davis then forwarded to Lee, who denied it.)
The attribution to Vinton comes from an entry in the diary of cadet Cyrus Ballou Comstock dated November 17, 1854: ""Seven months from today and our courses here closes-we were talking of it tonight. Webb has cut a sheet of drawing paper into cards to receive the autographs of one class, and Vinton painted a border consisting of various scenes around the Point and in Cadet life. A view of camp up the river, old Cog, […] his likeness is perfect. It is the best thing I have seen in a long time"". Comstock himself went on to be an important leader during the Civil War and was an aide to President Grant, appointed to oversee the Lincoln assassination trial. ""Old Cog"" refers to Lee, who referred to West Point as the ""Snake Pit"".
Vinton graduated from West Point with the Class of 1856 as the required course of study at West Point was changed from four years to five years in August 1854. He continued studying mine engineering in Paris, graduating from the Ecole de Mines in 1860. Upon returning to New York he taught mechanical drawing at Cooper Union. During the Civil War, he rose through the ranks to brigadier general but was badly wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. After the war he became a professor at the newly founded Columbia College School of Mines. He relocated to Colorado in 1877.
The similar style exhibited in Whistler's and Vinton's work shows the influence of the classmates' drawing teacher, Robert W. Weir. Indeed, a Vinton sketch at the Walters Art Gallery was first attributed to Whistler but later was changed to Vinton.
In an email, Whistler scholar Margaret MacDonald states she does not believe the vignettes in this work could be by Whistler because he was no longer at West Point by Comstock's journal account of November 17, 1854.
The work was owned by General Alexander Stewart Webb (1835-1911) and descended through his heirs. Webb graduated from West Point with the Class of 1855 and became a career U.S. Army officer. He served as a Union general during the Civil War and was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1891 for gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg. During the battle, Webb's brigade manned a portion of Cemetery Ridge and brilliantly succeeded in destroying an attacking Confederate brigade. The following day, during Pickett's Charge, Webb's Pennsylvanian's were situated in the famous ""copse of trees"" and bore the full fury of the surging forces. More than 450 of Webb's men were killed or wounded defending the ""high water mark"". Webb was among those wounded at Gettysburg and then later received a debilitating wound at Spotsylvania in 1864.
He remained in the army until 1870 when he was discharged at his own request. In his later years Webb served as president of New York City College. A statue of him still stands at Gettysburg.
Of note, Webb created a West Point Class of 1854 album, which included similarly scattered autographed cards, a drawing of Trophy Point signed ""Merrill"" and a topography map signed ""Webb"". Webb had many drawings and sketches by Whistler given to him during their time together at the Academy.

This original drawing was commissioned by Playboy and included in the October 1979 issue of Playboy Magazine (pages 225-227) in a feature that included works from designers such as Bill Blass, Oleg Cassini, Edith Head, Fernando Sanchez, and Monika Tilley, among others, who create their versions of the Playboy bunny costume. Candace Collins can be seen modeling some of the designs in the feature.
Oleg Cassini is an icon of twentieth-century fashion. Though born to Russian aristocracy and raised in Italy, he built a fashion empire that was unmistakably American. Cassini is perhaps best known for the hundreds of designs he created for First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy (see images 4-8), but his achievements as a collector, connoisseur, and quintessential twentieth-century man go far beyond Camelot.
In 1913, Oleg Cassini was born in Paris to the Russian diplomat Count Alexander Loiewski and Countess Marguerite Cassini, a Russian aristocrat of Italian ancestry who also had an interesting link to America. The daughter of Count Arthur Cassini, Russian Ambassador to the United States during the McKinley and Roosevelt administrations, Marguerite dazzled turn-of-the-century Washington as her father’s official hostess and left her mark on the capital city. Stationed in Denmark when the Russian Revolution toppled the czar, Ambassador Cassini and family were exiled to Switzerland before settling in Florence, Italy, where young Oleg was raised. A true Renaissance man, he spoke Russian, French, and Danish before adding Italian and English; he studied medieval and modern European military history and costume and learned to draw; he learned horseback riding, fencing, and the art of chivalry; and, most importantly, he came to understand the struggles of the Russian titled class and other European aristocrats in the wake of the Russian Revolution and World War I.
Countess Cassini started a successful fashion business in Florence, and soon the talented young Oleg was sent to Paris to sketch the latest collections for recreation in Italy. In Rome in his early 20s, Cassini created fashions for high society women and designed for a few films, which planted the seed for his move to Hollywood. The drive to reinvent himself brought Cassini to America in the 1930s; in his autobiography he describes arriving nearly penniless in mid-Depression New York City where his title as an exiled Russian Count meant even less than in war-devastated Europe. Down and out, Cassini struggled for employment, having sketching skills but no knowledge of the wholesale trade required for survival in Manhattan’s Seventh Avenue fashion district. However, he excelled at making connections, and Cassini slowly entered New York society. He was soon joined by younger brother Igor (who had studied in America and travelled with the young Emilio Pucci) and his parents, the once-dazzling Countess and his father, the displaced diplomat still loyal to Russia. The family settled in Washington, D.C., and Igor worked his way up the Hearst newspaper chain to become the famous society columnist Cholly Knickerbocker.
In New York, Oleg Cassini married the troubled socialite Merry Fahrney (who would go on to marry eight times), but the marriage ended in scandal for Oleg, and he decided to follow his original intention and head for Hollywood. Despite initial difficulties, Cassini gained access to Hollywood’s elite (partially through his skills on the tennis court), and was soon hired as a designer at Paramount Pictures alongside the redoubtable Edith Head. In her 1941 film debut I Wanted Wings, Veronica Lake wore a memorable Cassini design. That same year, Cassini met and married the newest young Hollywood star on the scene, the beautiful 20th Century Fox–talent Gene Tierney.
With the outbreak of World War II, Cassini enlisted in the Coast Guard but was transferred to the U.S. Army Cavalry which allowed officers of foreign birth. He attended basic training at Fort Riley, Kansas, and the horsemanship he learned as a boy served him greatly. He attended Officer Candidate School and reached the rank of First Lieutenant (he also became an American citizen at this time, losing his title of Count). Cassini spent several years posted at Fort Riley, where Tierney joined him before he landed a convenient military post in Hollywood. As Tierney’s career thrived (she played the title role in Otto Preminger’s Laura in 1944), she was able to assert her influence over 20th Century Fox’s head Daryl Zanuck, who hired Cassini as designer for Tierney on her 1946 film The Razor’s Edge, which proved to be a brilliant showcase for his talents. The pair separated the same year and, again seeking reinvention, Cassini re-established himself in New York City as a fashion designer. By 1950, the Oleg Cassini label was born.
Combining his knowledge of Old World and modern Europe, Hollywood, the tennis courts of Palm Beach and Newport, and of course, New York City, Oleg Cassini invented a new brand of fashion that was distinctly American and of its moment. For his first collection, Cassini took to the stage, narrating the looks and imbuing the scene with his personality, unusual in an industry where the designers typically remained backstage and the models were called by number over a PA. The first collection was a smash — the president of Lord & Taylor devoted all of their storefront windows to his designs — and by 1955 sales had reached $5,000,000. Oleg Cassini’s career had turned a very positive corner.
Cassini spent the early 1950s traversing the country, personally selling his collections to department stores in the interior, something his predecessors had never done, and moving between the Hollywood and New York scenes. Cassini’s brother Igor coined the term “the Jet Set” for this generation that constantly flew from New York to Los Angeles (then a ten-hour flight), Las Vegas, Paris, Rome, and the Riviera. In 1954, Cassini set out to woo Grace Kelly and sent her roses every day. The two were briefly engaged before her marriage to Prince Rainier of Monaco.
In December 1960, Cassini’s career-defining opportunity came when he was chosen by Jacqueline Kennedy to design her fashions for the White House. Cassini had long known Joe Kennedy and his war-hero son John, and had first met Jacqueline Bouvier before her marriage in the early 1950s. Invited by President-Elect Kennedy to meet Jacqueline at Georgetown Hospital (she had just given birth to son John Jr.) to present to her drawings of potential dresses and First Lady looks, Cassini worked furiously to prepare a new line for the First Lady. Mrs. Kennedy had always had her clothes made by the top French couturiers of the day, but for the White House she wanted an American designer. Cassini wrote in his autobiography that he told the First Lady: “‘You have an opportunity here,’ I said, ‘for an American Versailles.’ She understood completely what I was trying to communicate; she began to talk excitedly about the need to create an entirely new atmosphere at the White House. She wanted it to become the social and intellectual capital of the nation” (Oleg Cassini, In My Own Fashion, 1987, p. 327).
Mrs. Kennedy loved Cassini’s design for a gown to wear to the Inaugural Gala (she had already ordered a dress from Bergdorf’s for the Inaugural Ball), and Cassini was selected as the First Lady’s designer and was soon dubbed the “Secretary of Style.” From 1960 to 1963, Oleg Cassini would design over 300 items for Mrs. Kennedy, creating the “Jackie Look” that contributed not only to a fashion revolution but also the dawn of a new age. Cassini wrote that “Jackie played a very active role in the selection of her clothes. She loved brilliant colors — pistachio, hot pink, yellow, and white among others. Her sense of style was very precise; she would make editorial comments on the sketches I sent her. She always knew exactly what she wanted; her taste was excellent” (Oleg Cassini, In My Own Fashion, 1987, p. 334).
After the Camelot years, Cassini’s business flourished and grew into a major industry; his name appeared on everything from couture to tennis-, sport-, and swimwear, car interiors, housewares, and perfume. He collected beautiful and rare artwork, arms and armor, and antique furniture, and lived the lifestyle projected by his image. From this period onward, Cassini also came to live in important homes. Of his Gothic Gramercy Park townhouse on Manhattan’s 19th Street he would write imaginatively, “I walked into the foyer and immediately fell in love. It was a place unlike any other in New York, a sixteenth-century Dutch house transported brick by brick from Europe by the Wells Fargo family in the early twentieth century. There was a vaulted, twenty-foot ceiling in the living room, leaded windows, elegantly carved wood paneling in many rooms… It felt like home; I bought it on the spot, and spent the next few years decorating it. Soon the interior of the house looked exactly as I’d dreamed it would, like a sixteenth-century Florentine palazzo” (Oleg Cassini, In My Own Fashion, 1987, p. 361).
Of Moorelands, his country estate, Cassini wrote, “I realized I needed a country retreat that complemented my medieval home in the city; eventually I found it in Oyster Bay, Long Island — a splendid Edwardian mansion designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany, on 48 rolling acres overlooking Long Island Sound…I knew immediately that it possessed a beauty and grace…” (Oleg Cassini, In My Own Fashion, 1987, p. 391).
Oleg Cassini died in New York in 2006 at 92 years old.

The items are decorated in a black overglaze print of a pattern called the ""Tea Party no.3"".

I have several Worcester items available in black print, which together make a wonderful little tea set, please see separate listings.

The Tea Party pattern was very popular around this time as during the Rococo era, people got into the habit of drinking tea or coffee together. This particular pattern was created by Robert Hancock and was done in three different versions, this 3rd version being the rarest one. This image is an adaptation of an interior scene in Warburton's ""Works of Alexander Pope"". We can see a lady and a gentleman having tea and coffee, the gentleman serving himself from a tiny teapot, the lady from a silver coffee pot. The lady is also holding a treat for the dog under the table; the dog is waiting patiently in the foreground. There is a second scene on the reverse, where the maid is walking with a young dark-skinned servant who carries the kettle with hot water, presumably on their way to provide a top-up. They are chatting away. 

The Worcester Porcelain Company was one of the first potteries in Britain to produce porcelain. Alongside other great potteries such as Derby, Chelsea and Bow, they pioneered a new industry that would grow out to be huge in the following century. This plate is from the first period, which is often called the ""Dr Wall"" period after its founder. In later years Worcester went through many different ownerships and styles, and ultimately it became the Royal Worcester factory that only finished operation in the early 21st Century.

The items are unmarked, as was common during this period. 

Provenance: the Frank Herrmann Collection
Reference: page 387 of ""Worcester Porcelain 1751-1790 The Zorensky Collection"" by Simon Spero and John Sandon 

CONDITION REPORT Both items are in excellent antique condition without any damage, repairs or crazing. There is some rubbing throughout; the black rimline on the cup is nearly worn off. There is a chip off the footrim of the saucer, which is not visible when in position.

Antique British porcelain is never perfect. Kilns were fired on coal, and this meant that china from that period can have some firing specks from flying particles. British makers were also known for their experimentation, and sometimes this resulted in technically imperfect results. Due to the shrinkage in the kiln, items can have small firing lines or develop crazing over time, which should not be seen as damage but as an imperfection of the maker's recipes, probably unknown at the time of making. Items have often been used for many years and can have normal signs of wear, and gilt can have signs of slight disintegration even if never handled. I will reflect any damage, repairs, obvious stress marks, crazing or heavy wear in the item description but some minor scratches, nicks, stains and gilt disintegration can be normal for vintage items and need to be taken into account.
 
There is widespread confusion on the internet about the difference between chips and nicks, or hairlines and cracks. I will reflect any damage as truthfully as I can, i.e. a nick is a tiny bit of damage smaller than 1mm and a chip is something you can easily see with the eye; a glazing line is a break in the glazing only; hairline is extremely tight and/or superficial and not picked up by the finger; and a crack is obvious both to the eye and the finger. Etcetera - I try to be as accurate as I can and please feel free to ask questions or request more detailed pictures!","(diameter): cup 5.6cm (2.25""); saucer 12.3cm (4.75"")"

Published for an exhibition April 21-June 12, 2010, by L&M Arts, Netherlands, 2010. 1st Ed hardcover no dust jacket as issued. In 1942, at the opening of her Art of This Century gallery, Peggy Guggenheim famously demonstrated her equability toward both Surrealist and Abstract Art by wearing one earring made by Surrealist painter Yves Tanguy and one by abstract sculptor and kinetic artist Alexander Calder. Yet, the opposition implied by this act of truce-making perhaps overstates the antimonies between these two modernist masters. Tanguy and Calder shared many friends in Surrealist circles in Paris, and showed work in the same exhibitions throughout the middle of the century. In this book, full of color reproductions and important ephemera relating to the artists' shared history, Susan Davidson, Senior Curator of collections and exhibitions at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, explains the overlap between these two canonical modernists.
